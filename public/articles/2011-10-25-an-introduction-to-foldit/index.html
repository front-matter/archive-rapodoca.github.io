Foldit is quite playable and enjoyable in its own right, at least on the training levels I worked through.

<p><a href="http://fold.it">Foldit</a> is a multiplayer video game with the goal of solving unsolved structural biology problems. It&rsquo;s an example of what <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~biglou/">Louis Van Ahn</a> calls <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~biglou/ieee-gwap.pdf">&lsquo;Games with a Purpose&rsquo;</a>. Recently Foldit players helped <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.2119">solve the crystal structure M-PMV retroviral protease</a>.</p>
<p>Foldit is quite playable and enjoyable in its own right, at least on the training levels I worked through. One of the pleasant surprises is that players are given a variety of automated tools for energy minimization - they don&rsquo;t need to rotate every bond themselves. The game also does an excellent job of presenting the goal in a graphical way.</p>
<p>These and other factors move the gameplay into the level of thinking and strategy - and a genuinely fun experience.</p>
