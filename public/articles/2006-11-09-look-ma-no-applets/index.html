Although closed editors have long dominated this field, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Open Source editors<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are a possibly viable option.

<p><img src="/images/posts/20061109/webme.png" alt="WEbME" title="WEbME"></p>
<p>Through David Bradly&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sciencebase<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I came across a non-Java solution to the structure editor problem. The software is called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WebME<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. WebME looks and feels similar to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Java Molecular Editor<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It loads quickly and provides a clean, inviting user interface. It should work in any modern browser. Most interesting of all, WebME works without a browser plugin of any kind.</p>
<p>The magic behind WebME is AJAX, which has been summarized by Paul Graham as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Javascript now works&rdquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. By asynchronously interacting with a Web server as user interface events occur, WebME is able to cram a lot of functionality into a relatively small deployment package. The user interface is written in a mixture of HTML and JavaScript, thus eliminating the need for Java.</p>
<p>Although WebME&rsquo;s use of AJAX is innovative, other non-Java solutions to the structure editor problem have also been implemented. For example, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->PubChem<!-- raw HTML omitted --> have developed an editor in JavaScript/HTML for use with their popular service.</p>
<p>Despite its advantages, the AJAX approach does involve some trade-offs. For example, WebME is not nearly as responsive as, say, JME. I would imagine that unusually high network latency could further erode WebME&rsquo;s responsiveness. Furthermore, the subtle visual cues that make JME a productive tool, such as highlighting the node or edge the cursor is about to edit, are non-existent. It&rsquo;s unclear if this is a limitation of this particular version of WebME I used or the underlying technology.</p>
<p>AJAX is a promising new technology that may well have a place in producing ergonomic user interfaces for chemistry Web services. On the other hand, it wasn&rsquo;t too long ago that JavaScript &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t work&rdquo;, was loathed, or simply ignored altogether. It may well be that Java applets undergo a revival similar to that of JavaScript, perhaps triggered by built-in support for applets made possible through an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->open source Java implementation<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Regardless of how Java applet technology evolves, WebME&rsquo;s approach is worth serious consideration.</p>
