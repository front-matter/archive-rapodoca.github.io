Karwath and De Raedt are onto something more than just an innovative use of SMILES strings. When the majority of chemical informatics papers provide instructions for downloading both complete source code and complete data sets, the game will have changed forever. Advocating this postion in essays, presentations, emails, and letters is one way to make the case, and a very old one at that. For your next paper, why not make the case with a statement like the one above?">
