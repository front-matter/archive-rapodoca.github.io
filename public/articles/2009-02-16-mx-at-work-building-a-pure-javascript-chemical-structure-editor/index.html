    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p><a href="http://metamolecular.com/mx/">MX</a> is a fast, lightweight cheminformatics toolkit that can be used in many programming environments. Previous articles have shown how easy it is to use MX in <a href="/articles/2008/11/24/getting-started-with-mx">Ruby</a> and <a href="/articles/2008/12/01/open-source-cheminformatics-in-python-with-mx">Python</a>, but that&rsquo;s just the beginning.</p>
<p>Because MX is written in Java and is both small and self-contained, it can also be <a href="/articles/2009/01/06/javascript-for-cheminformatics-cross-compiling-java-to-javascript-with-gwt-revisited">compiled into pure JavaScript</a> thanks to the <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">Google Web Toolkit</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://chemhack.com/">Duan Lian</a> has taken this idea and run with it, creating a <a href="http://chemhack.com/jsmoleditor/">pure JavaScript chemical structure editor called jsMolEdit</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://chemhack.com/jsmoleditor/">new jsMolEdit demo page</a> is impressive: it reads molfiles, writes molfiles, and supports interactive drawing features such as moving, editing atoms and bonds, zooming in/out, and atom/bond highlighting.</p>
<p>jsMolEdit doesn&rsquo;t yet support some important features needed by an interactive structure editor, but it&rsquo;s an amazing proof of concept.</p>
<p>My company sells an applet-based <a href="http://metamolecular.com/chemwriter">chemical structure editor called ChemWriter</a>, from which the MX codebase was extracted. Although ChemWriter has been used successfully as a fast-loading, easy-to-use editor on a number of Web sites, one limitation is that users require a properly configured Java plugin for it to work. The possibility of deploying ChemWriter as a pure JavaScript tool is very attractive for this reason.</p>
<p>There are many other ways to apply the basic concept. For example, I recently wrote about JSpecView, a spectrum viewer/editor deployed as an applet.</p>
<p>Based on the jsMolEdit demonstration, it should be clear that this and many other interactive, pure JavaScript tools for chemistry are now well within reach.</p>
