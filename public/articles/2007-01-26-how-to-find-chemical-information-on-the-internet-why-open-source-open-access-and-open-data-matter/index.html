Unfortunately, a variety of barriers, both technical and cultural, restrict the use of the Web for chemistry. In the last few years, three powerful forces for change have emerged: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Open Source<!-- raw HTML omitted -->; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Open Access<!-- raw HTML omitted -->; and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Open Data<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Most of what&rsquo;s written on these subjects takes a theoretical angle that makes it difficult to visualize real benefits. In this article, I&rsquo;ll discuss these ideas from a much more practical perspective.</p>
<h1 id="a-thought-experiment">A Thought Experiment</h1>
<p>Try this simple thought experiment: using only a browser and the free Internet, find all Web pages pages that have anything scientifically-relevant to say about your favorite molecule. How would you do it?</p>
<h1 id="its-trivial">It&rsquo;s Trivial</h1>
<p>If you were lucky enough to have chosen a molecule with a trivial name such as &lsquo;caffeine&rsquo;, you could just try <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Google&rsquo;s first result would link you to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Caffeine Wikipedia article<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Wikipedia is an evolving phenomenon that, according to some critics, will never have a place in scientific research. It may not be ready now, but reading the meticulously annotated and cross-referenced entry for caffeine should make anyone who would say &ldquo;never&rdquo; at least a little nervous. Many of the citations in Wikipedia&rsquo;s caffeine article point to the primary scientific literature through <!-- raw HTML omitted -->PubMed<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>The remainder of Google&rsquo;s top-50 results are general audience items unlikely to interest a scientist keeping his or her nose to the grindstone: companies that sell caffeinated products; a variety of FAQs; self-help medical articles; and of course, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this one<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. We shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised. In the eyes of a massive search engine like Google, chemistry is just one of many niche markets.</p>
<p>Adding terms to our Google search might produce more targeted results. For example, what if we wanted to find a proton NMR spectrum of caffeine? We could type &ldquo;caffeine proton nmr&rdquo; into Google. The first result <!-- raw HTML omitted -->links<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, indirectly, to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->an article<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in the subscription-only <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Russian Journal of Physical Chemistry A<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. This does us no good because we have no subscription, limited funds, and no access to the journal at a library. The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->second link<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a direct hit: the proton NMR spectrum of caffeine in water-formic acid. Significantly, the information is contained in a peer-reviewed article (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->DOI<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) published by the Japanese <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Open Access<!-- raw HTML omitted --> journal, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Analytical Sciences<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The fact that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Analytical Sciences<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is an Open Access journal has made a world of difference in our search.</p>
<p>Although this might seem like the perfect solution, recall that the goal of the experiment was to locate <!-- raw HTML omitted -->all<!-- raw HTML omitted --> scientifically-relevant online content relating to the molecule. The technique we just used is most likely to succeed when we want specific information about molecules with a single trivial name. Even then, many resources may not cite a trivial name at all.</p>
<h1 id="the-real-world">The Real World</h1>
<p>Our options are even more limited when it comes to comprehensively text-searching even the simplest molecules lacking a widely-used trivial name. For example, consider the molecule represented by the systematic name &lsquo;3-phenyl-2-methylpropene.&rsquo;</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/20070126/example.png" alt="Example" title="Example"></p>
<p>If we were using a proprietary system such those offered by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Chemical Abstracts Services<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (CAS), we could simply enter the structure into a client and read off our results. This works because CAS isn&rsquo;t matching text when a query is submitted. Instead, it&rsquo;s matching molecular structures that have previously been encoded by both humans and machines.</p>
<p>The minute we step out of the orderly system created by CAS and into the chaos of the Internet, we confront a thorny problem. In practice, there are only two widely-used methods to convert a molecular structure diagram into a form that can be text-searched, and each has major limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>IUPAC Nomenclature</strong> This method has the advantage of being Open. It suffers from the complexity of its encoding rules, resulting in a variety of nonstandard implementations. As a result, it&rsquo;s possible to find multiple phrasings of the same IUPAC name, reducing its use as a unique identifier.</li>
<li><strong>CAS Numbers</strong> This method replaces a standard encoding system with a central registration authority. The advantages are that the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->representation<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of the identifier itself is unambiguous. Conversely, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->meaning<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of a CAS Number can only be known by referring to a registration authority. Unfortunately, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->current business model<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for CAS is based on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->restricting<!-- raw HTML omitted --> information flow, rather than promoting it.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="search-by-iupac-name">Search by IUPAC Name</h1>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try searching Google for IUPAC nomenclature. Entering &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->3-phenyl-2-methylpropene<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; produces a results page containing three unique entries. One of them <!-- raw HTML omitted -->links<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->database<!-- raw HTML omitted --> run from the University of Hamburg. I gather the purpose of this database, which I was unaware of before doing this search, is to link to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Landolt-Börnstein Online<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a collection of numerical data. Interestingly, a search for data on a single compound turned into the discovery of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->yet another free chemistry database<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>The remaining hits from the Google search linked to two pages (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->pdf<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->pdf<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) from ACS journals. The ACS routinely makes the first page of its articles a free download. It&rsquo;s interesting to note that these were the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->only<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ACS hits returned by Google.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve exhausted the possibilities with our chosen IUPAC name and Google. But before moving on to searching by CAS Number, we need to solve a problem. How do we get the CAS number for our compound?</p>
<h1 id="finding-a-cas-number-a-pubchem-detour">Finding a CAS Number: A PubChem Detour</h1>
<p>Concisely summarizing what PubChem does can be difficult because different users will emphasize different aspects of its design. For our purposes, PubChem probably contains a Web page describing the compound we&rsquo;ve been researching, and on that page may be a CAS number.</p>
<p>Submitting our molecule to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->PubChem&rsquo;s search page<!-- raw HTML omitted --> produces <!-- raw HTML omitted -->one result<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Fortunately, this page lists our compound&rsquo;s CAS number: 3290-53-7.</p>
<h1 id="search-by-cas-number">Search by CAS Number</h1>
<p>Submitting our CAS number to Google produces sixteen results. The first two link to the Landolt-Börnstein pages. The next result <!-- raw HTML omitted -->links to<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a product listing page for a chemical supplier.</p>
<p>The fourth result <!-- raw HTML omitted -->links to<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a far more interesting page - the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Organic Syntheses<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> website. Fortunately for us, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Organic Syntheses<!-- raw HTML omitted --> makes its contents freely available online. Following the link takes us to a preparation in which one of the reagents can be substituted with our molecule of interest. Further down in this page, we can see that this molecule has been further <!-- raw HTML omitted -->cross-referenced<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Two procedures are listed, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->one of which<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is new to us. Following the link, we find a complete synthetic procedure with full characterization and primary literature citations. Jackpot.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Organic Syntheses<!-- raw HTML omitted --> permits free public access, but is it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Open Access<!-- raw HTML omitted -->? Many would say not, due to the fact that it retains full copyright to its works and doesn&rsquo;t permit free redistribution. The distinction mainly matters to those seeking to create <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Open Data<!-- raw HTML omitted --> repositories based on the contents of periodicals such as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Organic Syntheses<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. To an end user, however, the distinction matters little in the short run.</p>
<p>The remaining results from our Google search are interesting, but mainly consist of chemical supplier catalogs. It should, however, be noted that <strong>all of the results</strong> returned by a Google search of our CAS number <strong>were relevant</strong> to our molecule of interest.</p>
<h1 id="inchi">InChI</h1>
<p>In an effort to overcome the limitations of CAS Registry Numbers and IUPAC systematic nomenclature as unique molecular identifiers, a new system has recently been introduced, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->IUPAC International Chemical Identifier<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (InChI). In contrast to a CAS number, an InChI can be assigned independently of a central authority. Like systematic nomenclature, an InChI can be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->decoded to a molecular representation<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Unlike IUPAC systematic nomenclature, an InChI is generated by a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->computer algorithm<!-- raw HTML omitted --> far too complicated for human use. The developers of the InChI software have released their work under an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Open Source<!-- raw HTML omitted --> license, promoting its widespread use by ensuring that services like PubChem will have no difficulties integrating InChI with their software infrastructures. Unlike either CAS Numbers or IUPAC names, InChIs are not yet in widespread use, a point which currently limits their utility.</p>
<p>The PubChem page for our search molecule listed an InChI, as do all PubChem Compound Summary pages. As shown by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Peter Murray-Rust and others<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, it is perfectly feasible to use Google to search for InChIs. Let&rsquo;s try.</p>
<p>Submitting our <!-- raw HTML omitted -->InChI query to Google<!-- raw HTML omitted --> gives no results. Leaving off the leading &lsquo;InChI=&rsquo; text, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->as briefly mentioned here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, also results in no hits. This tells us that Google has found no instances of our InChI, and that Google still does not crawl PubChem Compound Summary pages.</p>
<h1 id="use-a-free-database">Use a Free Database</h1>
<p>Numerous free chemistry databases are now running on the Internet. For example, a recent article highlighted <!-- raw HTML omitted -->thirty-two of them<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Would one of them be useful to our search? We need to ask ourselves if we really want to perform more than thirty individual searches. What if we were looking for data on several molecules? Nothing would prevent us from doing this in theory, but in practice, this is too much work.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;d really like is to submit a structure query to a single service that will query all of these free databases for us. While such services do exist in name, their breadth is restricted. A more comprehensive solution would be very helpful indeed.</p>
<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
<p>The Web&rsquo;s convenience and ubiquity have prompted many calls for greater Web accessibility to public chemical information. As hinted at by the examples in this article, Open Source, Open Data, and Open Access are three interrelated forces that can make this vision a reality. Open Access journals lower the economic barriers to compiling Open Data sources. Making these Open Data sources useful to scientists in a cost-effective way requires Open Source software. The availability of good Open Source software stimulates the creative combination of Open Data sources. And so on.</p>
<p>A lot needs to be done before this positive feedback loop can replace the status quo. But even with the chaotic, balkanized system that now exists, the benefits are plain to see. With even a small amount of coordination among Open Source software developers, Open Data providers, and scientific publishers, the most amazing things could happen.</p>
