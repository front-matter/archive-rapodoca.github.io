That is, given a half dozen years or so. At the time they&rsquo;re conceived, however, most good, obvious ideas just seem dumb, dangerous, or uninteresting. They have to - otherwise they&rsquo;d have been developed already.</p>
<p>Case in point: the blog permalink. If you&rsquo;ve ever read a blog, you know what a permalink is. It&rsquo;s the link you click when looking at a story headline in an RSS reader like <a href="http:/reader.google.com">Google Reader</a>.</p>
<p>If you run a blog, you definitely know what a permalink is. It&rsquo;s the link that a Google user follows when they search for a topic you&rsquo;ve written about. It&rsquo;s what other authors link to in their own writing, thereby increasing your ranking in Google. If your blog is anything like mine, <a href="/articles/2007/04/20/self-referential">Google drives a lot of your traffic</a>, and the permalink makes it all possible.</p>
<p>A permalink is nothing more than a fixed, unique identifier (URL) for online content. Blogging would have never caught on without it.</p>
<p>I recently ran across <a href="http://www.plasticbag.org/about/">Tom Coates&rsquo;</a> excellent <a href="http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2003/06/on_permalinks_and_paradigms/">essay on the lowly permalink</a>. He describes the time around 1999-2000 when permalinks didn&rsquo;t exist. If you ran a blog back then and wanted to write about someone else&rsquo;s blog post, you had to link to the other blog&rsquo;s home page. As the author you linked to continued to post, the content you had discussed in your own blog disappeared from the other author&rsquo;s front page, making your link irrelevant.</p>
<p>It was a huge problem, yet few perceived it as such. Interestingly, Coates even admits to having been <em>against</em> the idea of permalinks because of their <em>hacky</em> nature. Besides, they didn&rsquo;t seem to do anything useful.</p>
<p>So the next time you&rsquo;re stumped while trying to find something to work on that matters, try picking up a dumb, dangerous, or uninteresting - yet obvious - idea and run with it. In six year&rsquo;s time your invention may become so well known that most people couldn&rsquo;t imagine the world without it.</p>
