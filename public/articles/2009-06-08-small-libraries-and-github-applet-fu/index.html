<p><a href="http://products.metamolecular.com/2009/06/08/better-applet-deployment-with-applet-fu">More detailed discussion</a> of Applet-Fu is available from the <a href="http://products.metamolecular.com">Metamolecular Products Blog</a> and the <a href="http://chemwriter.com/articles/deployment-best-practices">ChemWriter Best Practices Deployment Page</a>.</p>
<p>Applet-Fu is a perfect example of the kind of open source project for which a service like SourceForge is overkill. The library consists of nothing more than a few lines of JavaScript in a single file, and some documentation. For this reason, Applet-Fu is <a href="http://github.com/metamolecular/applet-fu/tree/master">hosted on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>The project itself took about 60 seconds to create and upload. Perks include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://github.com/metamolecular/applet-fu/issues">issue tracking</a> easily integrated into source code management workflow</li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/guides/fork-a-project-and-submit-your-modifications">easy forking and re-merging</a> so that independent development efforts can be co-ordinated with minimal overhead</li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/metamolecular/applet-fu/blob/1919bc2883f98afa0524451f13423ed70470723c/applet-fu.js">highlighted source code</a> right in your browser</li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/metamolecular/applet-fu/network">graphical overview of development activity</a></li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/metamolecular/applet-fu/watchers">stay up to date</a> without subscribing to yet another mailing list</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many other ways to host open source projects, and GitHub won&rsquo;t be right in every situation. But for small, highly-focused projects, GitHub is well worth checking out.</p>
