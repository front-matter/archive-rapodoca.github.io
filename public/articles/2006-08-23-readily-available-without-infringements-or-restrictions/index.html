</blockquote>
<p>Science moves forward only insofar as observations can be validated and put to use by a third party. Chemical informatics is no different from any other field in this respect. Yet publications of the type Mr. Figueras opposed can still be found in 2006. Why is this?</p>
<p>At issue isn&rsquo;t just software. The ACS has recently spoken out on the necessity of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->open data sets<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. As a condition for publication, any data reported in a manuscript must now either appear in  Supplementary Material or be “readily available, without infringements or restrictions.” Although this is a positive development, the wait continues for an equivalent statement on the availability of source code.</p>
<p>Open software systems and open data packages are most useful when they can be readily found by others and used together. In an effort to work on this problem, several individuals, including myself, formed <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Blue Obelisk<!-- raw HTML omitted --> group. Through this group and others like it, like-minded researchers can begin to reap the benefits of openness <!-- raw HTML omitted -->enjoyed by other fields<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
