Mongrel is a fast Rails application container. It can be used in standalone mode - exactly like WEBrick. For hassle-free scaling, your Rails application can also be run on multiple Mongrel instances (either located on the same server or on multiple servers) behind a load balancer such as Pen, Balance, or Apache 2.1&#43;. Using Mongrel is very simple: it&rsquo;s packaged as a Ruby Gem and requires minimal configuration. Mongrel is also stable (Version 1.0 was just released), actively maintained (unlike lighttpd), and apparently quite secure.">

<p>What does this have to do with cheminformatics? Quite a lot if you, like me, see the Web as the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ideal platform<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for developing cheminformatics applications. Sure, a lot of technologies will need to be created first. But this is just another way of underscoring the big opportunities ahead. Future articles will discuss some of them.</p>
