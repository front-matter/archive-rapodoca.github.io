Ironically, this language which is so useful for human communication is extraordinarily difficult for machines to understand. Heroic efforts at digital raster image recognition such as <a href="http://cactus.nci.nih.gov/osra/">OSRA</a> and those <a href="http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2007/07/optical-chemical-structure-recognition.html">recently summarized by Egon Willighagen</a>, in addition to a <a href="http://depth-first.com/articles/2006/08/25/computational-perception-and-recognition-of-digitized-molecular-structures">handful of others</a>, have tried to tackle this problem with varying degrees of success.</p>
<p>The problem remains unsolved, and continues to be one of the most difficult technical challenges in cheminformatics. But the pace at which non-machine readable images are generated has accelerated dramatically in the last two years with the emergence of <a href="http://depth-first.com/articles/2007/01/24/thirty-two-free-chemistry-databases">numerous free chemical databases</a>.</p>
<p>What if 2D structure images simply contained all of the information needed for machine processing in the first place?</p>
<p>This idea isn&rsquo;t as far-fetched as it may sound initially. As discussed in a <a href="http://depth-first.com/articles/2007/07/30/editable-and-searchable-2d-molecular-images">recent D-F article</a>, both <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/gchempaint/">GChemPaint</a> and <a href="http://www.acdlabs.com/download/chemsk.html">ACD ChemSketch</a> have been claimed to be capable of encoding machine-readable structure information.</p>
<p>Previous D-F articles have described <a href="http://depth-first.com/articles/tag/firefly">&ldquo;Firefly&rdquo;</a>, the codename for a new lightweight 2D structure editor designed specifically for the Web. With major work on the editor&rsquo;s user interface complete, more recent efforts have focused on implementing a 2D rendering toolkit, and with it a mechanism to encode structural information within 2D molecular images.</p>
<p>As a demonstration of what is now possible, consider the structure of GlaxoSmithKline&rsquo;s diabetes treatment rosiglitazone (Avandia), depicted as a PNG image at the beginning of this article. At first glance, the image appears to be just like any other image of a 2D molecular structure. But it is not, for embedded within it are the connection table and 2D atom coordinates of rosiglitazone encoded as an industry-standard molfile.</p>
<p>Given the right software, a computer can interpret the structural information encoded in the rosiglitazone image and precisely re-create the original molecular representation. A graphical diagnostic tool bundled with Firefly was equipped with code for precisely this purpose.</p>
<p>This tool can work with molfile-encoded PNG images just as easily as it can with molfiles; they can be opened and the resulting molecule can be further edited, saved in another format, or re-written as a embedded-molfile PNG image.</p>
<p>The first step is to select the PNG image from a local hard drive:</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/20070801/file_open2.png" alt="File Open" title="File Open"></p>
<p>Opening this image produces a fully-editable version of the original molecule:</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/20070801/firefly.png" alt="Firefly" title="Firefly"></p>
<p>Obviously, nothing limits this technique to molfiles. InChI, SMILES, CML, or any other molecular encoding scheme would work just as well.</p>
<p>Using molecular-encoded PNG images as a Web-ready replacement for the <a href="/articles/2007/07/30/editable-and-searchable-2d-molecular-images">Word/Chemdraw OLE</a> technology may be one application of this approach. With a large corpus of these images, chemical Web spidering and data mining would be possible on a scale unimaginable today. As always, these possibilities reinforce the desperate need for high quality tools that chemists actually want to use, and which simultaneously yield machine-readable output.</p>
