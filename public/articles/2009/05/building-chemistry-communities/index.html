<p>It should be emphasized that whenever we talk about &lsquo;chemists&rsquo;, we&rsquo;re really making generalizations about a <a href="/articles/2008/05/07/1908-and-all-that-the-long-tail-and-chemistry">heterogeneous group</a>. Same applies to &lsquo;software developers&rsquo;. Keeping that in mind, here are some ideas for how the culture of professional chemists differs from the culture of professional programmers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Numbers. I believe Spolsky quoted an estimate of something like nine million professional programmers worldwide. ACS, <a href="http://portal.acs.org/portal/acs/corg/content?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=PP_ARTICLEMAIN&amp;node_id=222&amp;content_id=CTP_003319&amp;use_sec=true&amp;sec_url_var=region1&amp;__uuid=efd2dba8-becd-4154-98f9-45d20ce14fbf">&ldquo;the worlds largest scientific organization&rdquo;</a> says it has 158,000 members.</li>
<li>Entrepreneurship. Devs can (and do) freelance and form two- or three-person startups. <a href="/articles/2008/04/22/thinking-of-founding-a-science-startup-look-to-whats-getting-cheaper">Chemists rarely</a>.</li>
<li>Copyrights versus patents. Chemists have only one option to protect their intellectual property - patents. Devs can and do use both copyrights and patents. A copyright goes into effect the minute you create something. A patent is an expensive and drawn-out affair in which you can lose your rights by revealing your invention too soon to others.</li>
<li>History. Chemistry has a history going back hundreds of years - software development as we know it is barely a generation old.</li>
<li>Resource requirements. If you have a laptop, you too can be a successful software developer. It takes a lot more equipment than that to be a successful lab chemist. This resource requirement generally implies a significant organization behind it. That organization may not appreciate you posting questions to public forums that reveal the nature of your work.</li>
<li>Established communication channels. Science has a tradition of closed peer-review and publication in journals. This plays much less of a role in software development.</li>
<li>Secrecy. Whether you&rsquo;ve worked in industry or academics, you&rsquo;ve been exposed to this in one form or another. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_notebook_science">Open Notebook Science</a>, which is more analogous to the way open source software get created, is a radical idea for many chemists, and probably will be for some time.</li>
<li>Computer fluency. Devs spend most of their time using a computer. Lab scientists spend most of their time away from a computer. A site like StackOverflow can be immediately understood by any dev. Many chemists would need training to be able to understand its purpose and use it easily.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve deliberately selected differences that may be relevant to an online service like StackOverflow. There are doubtless many others as well. And then there may be some differences that haven&rsquo;t been considered here.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
