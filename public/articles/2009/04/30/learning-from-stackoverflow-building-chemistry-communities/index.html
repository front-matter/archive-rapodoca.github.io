<p>For the unfamiliar, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow</a> is a programming question and answer service. There are dozens, if not hundreds, of these things on the Web - and most of them are lame.</p>
<p>What StackOverflow did differently was to design a service from the bottom up that was specifically tailored to the culture of software developers. Every feature in StackOverflow is designed to maximize productive participation by a very specific community.</p>
<p>Sounds pretty <a href="http://depth-first.com/articles/2007/09/28/designing-the-obvious">obvious</a>, doesn&rsquo;t it? Yet consider that it took until this year for anybody to get the implementation right.</p>
<p>As Spolsky notes in his talk, StackOverflow as it now stands probably won&rsquo;t work for very many other communities.</p>
<p>For example, you might think that a StackOverflow for chemists might work well. Probably not. The problem is that chemists operate in a very different kind of cultural environment than software developers. Any system that ignored the difference would almost certainly fail. This isn&rsquo;t to say that there are no lessons to be learned - there are. But literal translation of the idea would ignore the very reason StackOverflow works in the first place.</p>
<p>The design of effective human-machine interfaces has pretty much been worked out. If you make the effort, almost everything you need to know has been written already.</p>
<p>Creating effective human-human interfaces through the Web, on the other hand, remains quite mysterious. It&rsquo;s far from clear why some work so much better than others. Few broadly-applicable principles have been articulated; we&rsquo;re still telling anecdotes.</p>
<p>But as far as anecdotes go, the StackOverflow case is well worth studying.</p>
