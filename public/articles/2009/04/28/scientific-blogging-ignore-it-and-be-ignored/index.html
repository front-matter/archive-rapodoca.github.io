<p><a href="http://usefulchem.blogspot.com">Jean-Claude Bradley</a> notes a <a href="http://usefulchem.blogspot.com/2009/04/is-it-becoming-dangerous-to-not-blog.html">shift in the discussion</a> about blogging and scientists. A few years ago, the concern was whether or not blogging could hurt your scientific career. Today, the discussion revolves around whether or not scientific blogging is a waste of time.</p>
<p>These questions may be important right now, but for any scientist with some life left in their career, the most important question is: What will the discussion of blogging and science look like ten years from now?</p>
<p>Only time will tell. But for what it&rsquo;s worth, here are some random observations I&rsquo;ve made about blogging and science (<a href="/articles/2007/08/09/ten-things-that-surprised-me-about-blogging">and some more here</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Over half the sales <a href="http://metamolecular.com">my scientific software company</a> has made have been a direct or indirect result of writing I&rsquo;ve published on <a href="/">Depth-First</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a> and mailing lists are highly inefficient compared to maintaining a well-written, current, and focussed scientific blog. LinkedIn forums sit behind a login, which hinders <a href="/articles/2009/01/02/the-electronic-laboratory-notebook-trap">discussions like this one</a> from taking place, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=electronic+laboratory+notebook">being found</a> later, and credited to you. Mailing lists are even worse - not only do they rank low in search results, but they&rsquo;re hard on the eyes, tend to be of very low signal-to-noise ratio, and you automatically shut out 99% of your potential audience, who don&rsquo;t subscribe (or bother to read) the particular list you&rsquo;re posting to.</li>
<li>Two words: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=substructure+search">substructure search</a>. Scientists are increasingly relying on Google, not SciFinder, to quickly find information. Without a blog, you&rsquo;re at a severe disadvantage with Google. That&rsquo;s such an important point, I&rsquo;ll say it again: You know that tool called Google that many of your colleagues are using to find scientific information - <a href="/articles/2007/04/20/self-referential">it will only locate your material easily if you maintain a blog</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recessions are a time when many scientists&rsquo; thoughts turn to the subject of how they&rsquo;re going to find another job. It&rsquo;s a time when words like &ldquo;networking&rdquo; get discussed in solemn tones by those with a knowing air about them.</p>
<p>Think of blogging as a way to <a href="/articles/2007/09/12/the-forward-pass-has-been-legalized-will-you-use-it">radically expand</a> the reach of your professional network. Now, how can you still afford to sit on the sidelines?</p>
