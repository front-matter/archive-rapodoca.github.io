<p>Currently, GitHub is mainly used to host source code. But nothing in the design prevents it from hosting data such as SD Files. In fact, this is exactly what has begun to happen with the <a href="/articles/2009/01/22/mx-performance-comparison-3-substructure-search-in-mx-and-cdk">cheminformatics benchmark project</a> I&rsquo;m currently working on. In this case, source code is being maintained along with data files. But what would happen if you just hosted data files?</p>
<p>If Bioclipse can import scripts from GitHub, why can&rsquo;t it import data as well? For that matter, why can&rsquo;t Bioclipse <em>write</em> data to GitHub?</p>
<p>And why can&rsquo;t your application do the same thing?</p>
