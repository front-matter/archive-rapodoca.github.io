If you&rsquo;re not familiar with it, <a href="https://japex.dev.java.net/">Japex</a> is a microbenchmarking framework written in Java that does for benchmarking what Ant does for building projects. Among its many interesting features is the ability to generate bar charts for performance comparisions.</p>
<p>Recently I finished building <a href="http://github.com/rapodaca/cheminfbenchmark/commit/106b561b9f7df7316bf31a3f25ef619e845d3efd">the first direct performance comparison</a> between <a href="http://cdk.sf.net">CDK</a> and <a href="http://metamolecular.com/mx/">MX</a>, two open source cheminformatics toolkits. The chart below summarizes the test.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/20090119/benchmark/testcase0.jpg" alt="Benchmark" title="Benchmark"></p>
<p>You can <a href="/images/posts/20090119/benchmark/index.html">read the full report for yourself here</a>. This test compares the relative speed of loading <a href="http://github.com/rapodaca/cheminfbenchmark/raw/9e7915b35c8da460ed6efed4f931ede6751d5baf/data/pubchem_sample_33.sdf">a 33-record SD file</a> and summing the calculated molecular masses from each record. As you can see, CDK is about 19% faster than MX on the system I looked at.</p>
<p>It should be pointed out that I&rsquo;m no expert with Japex, so it&rsquo;s possible that I&rsquo;ve introduced a source of error into this comparison that could affect the outcome.</p>
<p>Benchmarking is clearly a process, not an endpoint. In the months ahead, expect to see many more benchmarking comparisons, both between MX and other toolkits, and within MX itself.</p>
