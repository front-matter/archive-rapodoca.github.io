<blockquote>
<p>Yeah. The API has been arguably the most important, or maybe even inarguably, the most important thing we&rsquo;ve done with Twitter. &hellip; So, the API which has easily 10 times more traffic than the website, has been really very important to us. &hellip;</p>

<p>Done right, a Web API can add significant value to a website by offering a way for third-party developers to get involved. In other words, a Web API is a prerequisite for creating a Web platform.</p>
<p>One of the goals for <a href="http://chempedia.com">Chempedia</a> is to deliver an open, high-performance, Web-based platform for creating and consuming chemical information. One of the cornerstones of this plan is a robust Web API.</p>
<h1 id="a-bit-about-rest">A Bit About REST</h1>
<p>REST turns out to be very easy to understand when you consider that it&rsquo;s possible for machines to interact with Web services the same way humans interact with websites using a browser - by selecting and following hyperlinks.</p>
<p>The Chempedia Web API is built around this simple principle. For more information on the design of RESTful services and other high-level concepts, see the <a href="/articles/2009/08/07/the-restful-chemical-tracking-system-part-1-introduction">Depth-First RESTful chemical tracking series</a>.</p>
<p>The Chempedia API is based on the <a href="http://chemcaster.com/rest">Chemcaster API</a>, making it straightforward to port tools written for one to the other.</p>
<h1 id="api-step-by-step">API Step-By-Step</h1>
<ol>
<li>Start at <a href="http://chempedia.com/rest.json">http://chempedia.com/rest.json</a>.</li>
<li>Follow the link to Substances at <a href="http://chempedia.com/substances.json">http://chempedia.com/substances.json</a>.</li>
<li>View Substance detail by following link to <a href="http://chempedia.com/substances/1-0434-2394-1189.json">http://chempedia.com/substances/1-0434-2394-1189.json</a></li>
</ol>
<p>This is just a subset of what&rsquo;s available; more resources can be discovered by following the links provided in each representation. In this sense, the Chempedia API, like all REST APIs, is self-documenting.</p>
<p>Note: the &ldquo;.json&rdquo; extension is a convenience for viewing representations in a browser (be sure to install the <a href="/articles/2009/10/01/rest-tip-use-jsonview-for-in-browser-json-syntax-highlighting">JSONView plugin</a>). When writing client software for use with the Chempedia API, you must use the URIs given and set the &ldquo;Accept&rdquo; header to that given by the &ldquo;media_type&rdquo; attribute in each Link.</p>
<p>Also note that no assumptions should be made about URI structure. As with all REST systems, clients follow the links given; <a href="http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven">they never create links by themselves</a>.</p>
<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
<p>This article has given just a brief introduction of what&rsquo;s possible with the Chempedia API. Future articles will discuss the API in more detail.</p>
