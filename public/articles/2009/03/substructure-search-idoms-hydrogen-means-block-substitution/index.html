    <meta name="description" content="As you can see from the GitHub log, work on MX, the cross-platform, cross-language cheminformatics toolkit, is currently centered around adding support for complex structure queries with query atoms and query bonds. Although this is not a SMARTS system, the net result would the same - more control over structure queries.
The reason for this focus has to do with a commonly used, but not always implemented substructure searching idiom. Chemists using a substructure search system, like that to be included in ChemVendor, will want to &ldquo;block&rdquo; substitution on an atom by adding explicit hydrogens to arrive at the desired valence. So, for example, if Joe draws benzaldehyde with a hydrogen attached to the carbonyl carbon and submits a substructure search, he expects to see benzaldehydes, but not benzamides or benzoate esters.">
