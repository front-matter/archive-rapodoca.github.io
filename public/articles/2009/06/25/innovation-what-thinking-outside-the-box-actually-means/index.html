I generally find high-level discussions about innovation to be not terribly useful because they always seem to skirt the central issue, which I posted as a comment:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll know you&rsquo;re being innovative if you feel uncomfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best advice on the subject of innovation I ever got. It came from a talk given at an innovation symposium held by a company at which I did a summer internship. Most speakers said something along the lines of &ldquo;think outside the box&rdquo;, which when you really think about it is nothing more than useless tautology.</p>
<p>But one scientist offered the advice above. Now that&rsquo;s useful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to lose sight of the fact that every single product we think of today as being innovative started out as a piece of junk almost nobody cared about. Stuff that ‘experts&rsquo; in the field said could never work. Stuff that no serious person (or company) would ever waste time or money with.</p>
<p>The iPod entered a market with several of other digital music players and was not expected by most tech observers to do very well. Netflix is an innovative service – but if so, why didn&rsquo;t Blockbuster develop it instead? In both cases it&rsquo;s a mistake to confuse what now exists with what existed when the respective products were launched.</p>
<p>Now, just because you feel uncomfortable doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re being innovative. You could be doing something merely <a href="http://www.darwinawards.com/">stupid</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Madoff">criminal</a> instead.</p>
<p>But if what you&rsquo;re now working on is widely-regarded as the &lsquo;correct&rsquo; approach, you&rsquo;ve either made it through the period of being uncomfortable with your innovative idea and others are starting to come around (congratulations!), or you&rsquo;re not being very innovative.</p>
