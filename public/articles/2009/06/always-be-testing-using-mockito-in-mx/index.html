Like any technique, it has its limitations and isn&rsquo;t applicable in every situation. Nevertheless, TDD is a powerful method to create more robust low-level code and more effective high-level designs.</p>
<p>The early days of TDD were not much fun. The reason: the whole idea behind object-oriented software is to divide responsibilities among cooperating objects, which greatly complicates independent testing of isolated object behavior. A test that started out verifying the behavior of a single object could quickly become a test verifying the behaviors of large numbers of dependent objects (and their dependencies) as well.</p>
<p>An approach to this problem that has gained traction over the last few years is <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html">mocking and stubbing</a>. Although the terminology has become a bit tortured, the basic idea is to use stand-in objects whose behaviors can be pre-defined and later verified when testing an object with dependencies.</p>
<p>If all of this sounds a bit abstract, consider this example from <a href="http://metamolecular.com/mx">MX</a>, the lightweight cheminformatics toolkit.</p>
<p>Current activity in MX is focused on a Walker class that &lsquo;walks&rsquo; the graph structure of a Molecule representation in depth-first order, reporting what it finds to a Reporter. To direct its progress, a Walker uses a Step. So, to write tests for Walker, we&rsquo;re dealing with at least two dependencies: Step and Reporter.</p>
<p>Given that we&rsquo;d like to use test-driven development, how do we write the first Walker test?</p>
<p>The approach taken in MX is to use mock objects created with the <a href="http://mockito.org/">Mockito</a> library. Although there are many mocking solutions for Java, I&rsquo;ve found Mockito to be the most  intuitive and easy to use.</p>
<p>For example, consider this test, which verifies that a Walker doesn&rsquo;t continue walking past a maximum depth (click <a href="http://github.com/rapodaca/mx/blob/36d044b6ca2f5ec8cc71db25545fa2a3ca368458/src/com/metamolecular/mx/test/DefaultWalkerTest.java">here</a> to see the whole test):</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>where doStep simply calls walker.step:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In other words, rather than concocting a real Molecule that would set up the path behavior we need to test, we set up the states of all our dependencies directly such that they exhibit the testable behavior.</p>
<p>This buys us a couple of things. First, when our test fails, we can be sure it&rsquo;s failing because of either the way we set it up or the Walker implementation we&rsquo;re testing - not the dependencies. Second, we can specify the test environment and the actions taken on it with far greater precision.</p>
<p>There are many approaches to solving the testing dependency problem, and this is but one. Finding an approach that works for you can be a powerful way to increase your individual productivity and that of your team.</p>
<p><em>Update June 29, 2009: The original test didn&rsquo;t work as intended and has since been replaced with a simpler approach that does.</em></p>
