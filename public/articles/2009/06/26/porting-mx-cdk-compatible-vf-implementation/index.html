Although a few algorithms for atom-by-atom comparison of two structures are available, one of the fastest is <a href="/articles/2008/11/17/substructure-search-from-scratch-in-java-part-1-the-atom-mapping-problem">VF</a>, which is implemented in <a href="http://metamolecular.com/mx">MX</a>, a lightweight cheminformatics toolkit.</p>
<p>A recent post discussed the <a href="/articles/2009/06/16/if-the-wheel-doesnt-work-reinvent-it">limitations of directly porting the C++ implementation of VF into Java</a> and why a Java-centric, de novo implementation was created for MX instead.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now happy to report that <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~asad/Asad.html">Syed Asad Rahman</a> of the <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/">European Bioinformatics Institute</a> has created a <a href="http://github.com/asad/VFLib/tree/master">preliminary implementation of VF</a> for the Chemistry Development Kit (<a href="http://cdk.sf.net">CDK</a>) by porting the MX mapping package.</p>
<p>Looking through Asad&rsquo;s work, one of the most striking things is the isolation of CDK-specific code into a few key areas, a trait shared by the original MX implementation. Another is the readability of the code. Both features should greatly simplify further optimization work.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve been looking for a fast substructure search engine for your cheminformatics work, I recommend checking out both <a href="http://metamolecular.com/mx">MX</a> and the <a href="http://github.com/asad/VFLib/tree/master">CDK port</a>.</p>
