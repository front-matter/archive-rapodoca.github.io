Issue tracking is a critical feature for many software projects. Over the weekend I had a chance to play with a new GitHub feature - integrated issue tracking.
A specific example from MX, the lightweight cheminformatics toolkit, illustrates the process. It was found that MX was throwing an exception where none should be thrown. A new issue was created describing the observed behavior in terms of a failing test. After diagnosing and eliminating the problem, the issue was closed by adding &lsquo;Closes #2&rsquo; to the git commit message. And voila - the issue was closed with a link to the commit that closed it and a link to the original issue in the commit page.">
