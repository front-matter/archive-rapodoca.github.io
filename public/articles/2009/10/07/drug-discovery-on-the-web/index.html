<p>CDD is interesting at a number of levels. I&rsquo;m most intrigued by how CDD has embraced the Web as a platform for scientific collaboration. It&rsquo;s also interesting to see <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> being used in the context of a large scientific application.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see much written about CDD by users themselves (which is a little surprising), but I think there&rsquo;s a lot these folks can teach developers about how to create chemistry-focused Web applications.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a CDD user, how do you use the service and what are your likes/dislikes?</p>
