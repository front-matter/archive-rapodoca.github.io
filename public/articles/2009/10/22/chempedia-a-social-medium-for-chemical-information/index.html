    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>I&rsquo;d like to thank all of those who have participated in alpha testing of the new Chempedia - by setting up an account through the streamlined <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a>-based system, contributing a substance name, registering a substance, reviewing a substance name, or simply verifying that the service works as expected on their systems.</p>
<p>One question I get asked, even by those who have used the alpha site, relates to the purpose of Chempedia. I thought I&rsquo;d answer that question here.</p>
<p>Chempedia aims to fundamentally change for the better the way chemical information is created, managed, and distributed. It will do so through a free and open Web-based platform combining the best aspects of open access, new social media, and peer review.</p>
<p>By design, Chempedia places people at the center of the action. But more on that later.</p>
<p>The key technical component of this new system is a free and open chemical substance registry. The purpose of this registry is fivefold: (1) to provide a short, numerical &ldquo;Global Substance Identifier&rdquo; (GSID) that can be used to quickly and unambiguously identify substances in any medium; (2) to connect substances with existing chemical information sources through high-quality synonyms; (3) to provide a publicly-accessible canonical URI for every substance in the registry; (4) to offer the capability for any interested party to quickly register a new substance on demand and free of charge; and (5) to offer powerful tools for locating high-quality resources pertaining to individual substances.</p>
<p>Each of these five capabilities are essential in creating the open, <a href="http://depth-first.com/articles/2009/07/10/linked-chemical-data-google-techtalks">linked chemical information systems</a> that will be central to chemistry&rsquo;s future.</p>
<p>The Web has changed the rules for information creation and distribution; it&rsquo;s time to embrace this change in chemistry.</p>
