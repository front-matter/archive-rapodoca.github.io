<p>Mobile devices are not only getting cheaper and more powerful, but they are practically begging for laboratory notebook-like applications to be built specifically for them. Their chocolate-bar form factors, low startup latency, and pin-sharp graphics make them intriguing candidates to replace awkward laptops and tablet computers in chemically-hostile environments.</p>
<p>The problem is that the mobile device industry is still in its infancy; unlike laptops and desktops, there is still plenty of room for newcomers to turn the market upside-down. Fewer things are more discouraging to a potential application developer.</p>
<p>One approach is to view mobile devices as just another consumer of Web resources and stick to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript customized for a mobile form factor. The downside is that certain kinds of services that might be quite useful in a laboratory - such as a camera - might not be available through a browser-based client.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is an alternative - <a href="http://www.appcelerator.com/products/titanium-mobile/">Titanium Mobile</a>. This platform enables developers to write a single version of their application in JavaScript/CSS/HTML that gets compiled to native binaries for both <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="http://www.android.com/#utm_campaign=en&amp;utm_source=en-ha-na-us-bk&amp;utm_medium=ha&amp;utm_term=android">Android</a> mobile devices.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t yet used Titanium Mobile, but plan to do so in the next few weeks. If you have a small laboratory application that could benefit from software written for a mobile device platform, I&rsquo;d like to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hear from you<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
