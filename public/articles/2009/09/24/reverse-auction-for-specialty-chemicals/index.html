<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_auction">Reverse Auctions</a>, in which sellers compete for the business of buyers, have been used for some time outside of chemistry. But to my knowledge, no service exists in which multiple specialty chemical suppliers compete in real-time to fulfill orders placed by individual chemists.</p>
<p>There may be reasons no such service exists. It may be that the economics of companies competing for small orders don&rsquo;t work out well. It might be that buyer and seller confidentiality concerns would outweigh the conveniences offered to both parties.</p>
<p>Or maybe there&rsquo;s something here worth exploring.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a chemist - how often would you use such a service and what would it need to offer to be successful?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a chemical supplier, how would a reverse auction fit in with your current business model?</p>
