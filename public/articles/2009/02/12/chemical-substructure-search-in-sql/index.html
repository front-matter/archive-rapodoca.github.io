    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Earlier this year, Golovin and Henrick published a novel technique for performing <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ci8003013">substructure search on large databases using SQL</a>. What makes this approach unique is that it takes advantage of the built-in breadth-first search capabilities of most database engines to do structure matching. At least three public-facing sites now use the system, including <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/chemsearch/">this one at EMBL-EBI</a>.</p>
<p>Very recently, <a href="http://blog.charliezhu.com/">Charlie Zhu</a> released an implementation of the idea called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sqlmol/">sqlmol</a>. As you can see, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sqlmol/source/browse/#svn/trunk">the source</a> consists of sql files.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not skilled enough with SQL to know how to use sqlmol. Questions in my mind at this point mainly revolve around performance and the ability to do <a href="http://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.smarts.html">SMARTS</a> queries. The Golovin and Henrick paper does make some mention of performance, but my sense is there&rsquo;s more to look at here.</p>
<p>With an open source implementation apparently now being developed, it should be possible to answer these and many other questions.</p>
