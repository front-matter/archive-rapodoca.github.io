Part of the reason is cultural; part is technical. The good news is that the situation is starting to change for the better on both fronts.</p>
<p>For the last two years, Depth-First has discussed, sometimes in great detail, many of the technical issues facing chemistry as it slowly begins to embrace the Web. But that&rsquo;s only part of the story.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong - I still think that focusing on a specific subject, in this case Web-centric cheminformatics, is the key to good communication. But it doesn&rsquo;t reflect the whole picture.</p>
<p>Cheminformatics only has value to the extent that its tools are embraced and used regularly by working chemists.</p>
<p>To that end, <a href="http://metamolecular.com">my company</a> has started a new blog called <a href="http://zusammen.metamolecular.com">Zusammen</a> that&rsquo;s intended to bring chemists and those building Web-centric cheminformatics systems together. The idea is simple: from time to time feature short stories from around the world that show how the Web is being used in Chemistry.</p>
<p>Depth-First will continue to exist, but in a more technically-oriented form (if that&rsquo;s possible), and with a redesign (ETA unknown). The old blogging engine that I started with has served me well, but is really showing its age and frailty. This offers a good opportunity to address some longstanding issues and generally re-think how a technically-oriented blog should look and act.</p>
<p>There may be some interesting crossover as Zusammen begins to feel for its direction. I find that reader feedback makes all the difference in getting there. If you&rsquo;re interested in the future of the Web and chemistry, I hope you&rsquo;ll consider stopping by, and maybe posting a comment or two.</p>
