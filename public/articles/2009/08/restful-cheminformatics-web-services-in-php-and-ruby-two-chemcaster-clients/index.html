Although it is possible to code directly to an HTTP interface, few things flatten a learning curve more than working at a higher level in a language you know well.</p>
<p>Over at the <a href="http://products.metamolecular.com/2009/08/31/now-available-ruby-and-php-clients-for-chemcaster">Metamolecular Products Blog</a>, two clients for <a href="http://chemcaster.com">Chemcaster</a> have been announced - one written in <a href="http://github.com/metamolecular/chemcaster-php/tree">PHP</a> and the other written in <a href="http://github.com/metamolecular/chemcaster-ruby/tree">Ruby</a>. (Chemcaster is the cheminformatics Web services platform designed for rapid creation of rich chemistry websites). These clients are the first to enable interaction with the new <a href="http://chemcaster.com/rest">Chemcaster REST API</a>.</p>
<p>Regardless of your interest in Chemcaster itself, the client libraries may be worth checking out. Chemcaster exposes a RESTful, <a href="http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven">hypertext-driven</a> API that offers some important advantages over REST-RPC hybrid architecture commonly seen on the Web today. Both libraries illustrate how concise and flexible the underlying code to consume this kind of Web API can be.</p>
<p>And if the idea of simplifying the creation of rich chemistry websites through cheminformatics Web services appeals to you, please feel free to <a href="http://chemcaster.com/invitation_requests/new">request a Chemcaster testing account</a>.</p>
