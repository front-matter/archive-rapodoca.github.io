What motivated these volunteer abstracters? Enlightened self-interest probably played a role. After all, preparing a set of abstracts in a field you do research in can pay off in your own increased productivity.

    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Until 1966, Chemical Abstracts Service used <!-- raw HTML omitted -->volunteers<!-- raw HTML omitted --> exclusively to abstract the chemical literature. At the system&rsquo;s peak, thousands of scientists were willing and even enthusiastic to perform this tedious, demanding work for very little pay. The system was eventually phased out in favor of the professional abstracting service that replaced it.</p>
<p>What motivated these volunteer abstracters? Enlightened self-interest probably played a role. After all, preparing a set of abstracts in a field you do research in can pay off in your own increased productivity. It&rsquo;s also a good way to stay current with the literature, something you would do anyway. If your abstracts help your fellow scientist at the same time, so much the better. Another motivation could have been a simple desire to create order out of chaos, not unlike the many <!-- raw HTML omitted -->social networking activities<!-- raw HTML omitted --> flourishing on the internet today. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Christoph Steinbeck<!-- raw HTML omitted --> will be giving a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->talk<!-- raw HTML omitted --> at the Fall 2006 ACS touching on this theme, and it&rsquo;s likely others will too as the field gathers momentum.</p>
<p>In browsing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dylan Stiles&rsquo; blog<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I came across <!-- raw HTML omitted -->an entry<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on the aldehyde-&gt;alkyne homologation. In it, Stiles cited a brief, but informative <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wikipedia review<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on this reaction.</p>
<p>Surely this couldn&rsquo;t be the only example of online volunteer-created reviews in chemistry on Wikipedia. A quick search resulted in numerous examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wittig Reaction<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Grignard Reaction<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sharpless Dihydroxylation<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Diels-Alder Reaction<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thermite Reaction<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Danishefsky Taxol Total Synthesis<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Olefin Metathesis<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->McMurry Coupling<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Robinson Annulation<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Swern Oxidation<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cholesterol<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
</ul>
<p>The proliferation of this kind of volunteer, peer-reviewed chemical documentation is similar in spirit to that used by CAS in earlier times, although the technology couldn&rsquo;t be more different. Of course, this approach is not without its limitations and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->potential pitfalls<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but it is remarkably <!-- raw HTML omitted -->self-correcting<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. This emerging system offers something that CAS will never be able to provide - involvement in, and ownership of, the documentation process itself.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, chemical informatics technologies have not kept up with internet technologies and the people currently using them. The reliance on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->raster images of 2-D structures<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and the lack of a reliable web-enabled chemical indexing system both loom especially large as future problems to be addressed. What tools does this new kind of chemical publishing need to become more effective and efficient? How can these tools be made as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->invisible<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as possible?</p>
