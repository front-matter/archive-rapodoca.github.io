<p>Given the wealth of free chemical information sources appearing in a variety of formats, from blogs to videos to <a href="/articles/2007/01/24/thirty-two-free-chemistry-databases">databases</a>, could the ScienceHack model of expert-selected scientific information be the start of a new trend in scientific Internet startups?</p>
<p>Currently, ScienceHack&rsquo;s links point to mostly standard general chemistry demonstrations found on <a href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</a> and <a href="http://video.google.com/">Google Video</a>. This could get considerably more interesting if research chemists begin to experiment more with video as a medium for communicating results. Regardless, ScienceHack demonstrates the value of indexing free stuff in science.</p>
