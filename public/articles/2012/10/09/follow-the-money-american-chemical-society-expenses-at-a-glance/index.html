The chart was compiled from American Chemical Society (ACS) audited financial statements for the years 2007-2011.
For ACS income over the same period, see the preceding post in this series.
To give some perspective, total ACS revenues in 2011 stood at $499.8 million and expenses totalled $479.9 million.
Where it All Goes
For those familiar with ACS, two things stand out: (1) &ldquo;Information Services&rdquo; comprise an eyebrow-raising 70-75% of annual ACS expenses; and (2) ACS&rsquo; much-talked-about &ldquo;Education&rdquo; programs consistently total less than 2% of ACS expenses.">

<p>The chart was compiled from American <a href="http://portal.acs.org/portal/PublicWebSite/about/aboutacs/financial/">Chemical Society (ACS) audited financial statements</a> for the years 2007-2011.</p>
<p>For <a href="/articles/2012/09/20/follow-the-money-american-chemical-society-income-at-a-glance/">ACS income</a> over the same period, see the preceding post in this series.</p>
<p>To give some perspective, total ACS revenues in 2011 stood at $499.8 million and expenses totalled $479.9 million.</p>
<h1 id="where-it-all-goes">Where it All Goes</h1>
<p>For those familiar with ACS, two things stand out: (1) &ldquo;Information Services&rdquo; comprise an eyebrow-raising 70-75% of annual ACS expenses; and (2) <a href="portal.acs.org/portal/PublicWebSite/education/index.htm">ACS&rsquo; much-talked-about &ldquo;Education&rdquo; programs</a> consistently total less than 2% of ACS expenses.</p>
<p>The next biggest expense in the ACS budget is Adiminstrative, consistently around 8%. For comparison, the American Red Cross is reported to have an <a href="http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=3277">administrative expense percentage of 4%</a>.</p>
<p>Roughly tied for third place are &ldquo;Grants and Awards&rdquo; and &ldquo;Membership and Scientific Advancement&rdquo;. Although Grants and Awards seems straightforward enough (these are constantly discussed in the pages of C&amp;EN and at ACS events), what goes into the category of &ldquo;Membership and Scientific Advancement&rdquo; is not so clear. Both of these categories together have consistently totalled around 10% of ACS expenses over the years.</p>
<p>Given the outsized proportion of revenues from &ldquo;Electronic Services&rdquo; and &ldquo;Print Services&rdquo;, it shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising that ACS expenses fall overwhelmingly into the &ldquo;Information Services&rdquo; category. Although exactly what constitutes an Information Services expense is anybody&rsquo;s guess, the most likely candidates would be charges related to ongoing maintenance of <a href="http://www.cas.org/">Chemical Abstracts Service</a> and <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/">ACS Publications</a>.</p>
<h1 id="how-much-money-do-chemical-abstracts-service-and-acs-publications-earn">How Much Money Do Chemical Abstracts Service and ACS Publications Earn?</h1>
<p>How much money does ACS actually make from publication and information services? That&rsquo;s a tough question. A very rough estimate can be obtained by subtracting &ldquo;Information Services&rdquo; expenses from the sum of &ldquo;Electronic Services&rdquo; and &ldquo;Print Services&rdquo; in any given year. For 2011, the difference was +$59.8 million ($403.8 million + $10.3 million - $354.3 million).</p>
<p>By this crude (and flawed) method we can estimate that last year ACS generated about $59.8 million in &lsquo;profit&rsquo; (a margin of roughly 12%) from ACS publications and Chemical Abstracts. This money was then redistributed througout the organization in various ways.</p>
<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
<p>Inflows and outflows of money often paint a picture of an organization&rsquo;s values, a view that may or may not apply to ACS. Regardless, ACS&rsquo; financial statements make it clear that member activies take a back seat to publishing and information services - both in the top and bottom lines.</p>
