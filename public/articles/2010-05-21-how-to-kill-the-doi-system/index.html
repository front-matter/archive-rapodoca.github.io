<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten just a few too many of these kinds of these DOI fail messages lately and it&rsquo;s starting to get old. Call me crazy, but when <a href="http://depth-first.com/articles/2010/04/15/wiley-doi-fail">a DOI resolution still doesn&rsquo;t work after one month</a> and there&rsquo;s not so much as a confirmation that the problem is being looked at (or that maybe I&rsquo;m doing something wrong), that&rsquo;s no way to serve customers or build confidence.</p>
<p>As part of <a href="http://depth-first.com/articles/2010/04/08/wanted-a-few-good-chemists">an ongoing project</a>, I&rsquo;ve found numerous examples of failed DOI resolutions. The problem is that the source of these failures is the links contained in the syndication feeds created by the publishers themselves.</p>
<p>In effect, these DOI resolution problems make it impossible to view the article described in a journal&rsquo;s own feed.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, the DOI resolution service hosted at <a href="http://dx.doi.org">http://dx.doi.org</a> is controlled exclusively by the <a href="http://www.crossref.org/">CrossRef organization</a>. Perhaps this lack of customer focus is the price we must pay for tolerating monopolies of any sort as gatekeepers of scientific information.</p>
<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s time to think of a different way.</p>
