    <meta name="description" content="The first beta version of MX 1.0 has been released. MX is a lightweight cheminformatics toolkit written in Java that emphasizes efficiency, modularity, and readability. Incorporating many changes, this release introduces support for query atoms and Superatoms.
Fully supported MX features include:

Substructure search and atom mapping based on the VF algorithm
Exhaustive ring perception based on the Hanser algorithm
Flexible query atom support
Depth-First traversal
Implicit hydrogen detection
Complete system of atomic masses and isotopes based on the IUPAC Technical Report.
Model objects (Molecule, Atom, Bond, Superatom) based on MDL CTfile specification
Molfile reader and writer
SD File reader and writer

A beta period of about 1-2 weeks is anticipated before release of version 1.0. If you find a bug, a report would be greatly appreciated.">
