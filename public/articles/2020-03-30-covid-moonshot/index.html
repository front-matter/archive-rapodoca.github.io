The idea has taken a variety of forms over the years, but in essence is an attempt to replace closed, proprietary processes with open, public ones. A new initiative, the <a href="https://covid.postera.ai/covid">COVID-19 MoonShot</a>, seeks to apply similar principles to development of antiviral treatments for COVID-19. This article offers an overview of the effort.</p>
<h1 id="covid-moonshot-project">COVID MoonShot Project</h1>
<p>The COVID MoonShot Project is an <em>ad hoc</em> group of individuals and institutions working to develop a drug inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M<!-- raw HTML omitted -->pro<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). Participating institutions include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Home.html">Diamond Light Source</a>. The UK national synchrotron science facility.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.weizmann.ac.il/Organic_Chemistry/London/">London Lab</a>. A research lab located at the Weizmann Institute (<a href="https://twitter.com/london_lab">Twitter</a>).</li>
<li><a href="https://postera.ai">PostEra AI</a>. A Y-Combinator funded medicinal chemistry as a service startup.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h1>
<p>The two best sources for up-to-date information about the project are the <a href="https://covid.postera.ai/covid">Website</a> and the <a href="https://twitter.com/covid_moonshot">Twitter account</a>. What follows has been mostly gleaned from them.</p>
<h1 id="msupprosup-as-the-target">M<!-- raw HTML omitted -->pro<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as the Target</h1>
<p>MoonShot&rsquo;s focus is the M<!-- raw HTML omitted -->pro<!-- raw HTML omitted --> protease, also known in the older literature as 3CL<!-- raw HTML omitted -->pro<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. This enzyme was <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/300/5626/1763?ijkey=0a8e5246a508573738f4b6f57c540972d64be6a6&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha">first characterized by X-ray crystallography</a> in 2003 using the enzyme expressed by SARS-CoV-1. M<!-- raw HTML omitted -->pro<!-- raw HTML omitted --> cleaves a polyprotein chain transcribed from viral RNA at 11 or more sites. The enzyme is thought to exist as a dimer in its active state, with an unobstructed, shallow active site hosting a catalytic Cys-His diad. M<!-- raw HTML omitted -->pro<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is thought to be essential for the virus, but evidence on this point seems fuzzy at best.</p>
<p>More recently, the <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/03/20/science.abb3405">X-ray crystal structure</a> of SARS-CoV-2 M<!-- raw HTML omitted -->pro<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was determined both alone and bound to peptides <strong>13a</strong>, <strong>13b</strong>, and <strong>14b</strong>. Inhibition of purified recombinant CARS-CoV-2 M<!-- raw HTML omitted -->pro<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by <strong>13b</strong> was determined as 670 nM. A functional assay of SARS-CoV-2 activity using <strong>14b</strong> was performed (EC<!-- raw HTML omitted -->50<!-- raw HTML omitted --> 4-ÂµM). Mouse ADME parameters for both <strong>13a</strong> and <strong>13b</strong> were determined.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As-yet <a href="https://www.diamond.ac.uk/covid-19/for-scientists/Main-protease-structure-and-XChem.html">unpublished results</a> from the <a href="https://www.diamond.ac.uk">Diamond Light Source</a> have yielded X-ray crystal structures for 66 fragments, 44 of which were covalently bound to SARS-CoV-2 M<!-- raw HTML omitted -->pro<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Data are available in a <a href="https://www.diamond.ac.uk/covid-19/for-scientists/Main-protease-structure-and-XChem/Downloads.html">variety of formats</a>, including PDB and Excel files.</p>
<p>The goal of the COVID MoonShot project is to apply the growing amounts of structural data on M<!-- raw HTML omitted -->pro<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to the development of &ldquo;effective, easy-to-make anti-COVID drugs.&rdquo;</p>
<h1 id="timeline">Timeline</h1>
<p>The Diamond Light Source team has compiled a <a href="https://www.diamond.ac.uk/covid-19/for-scientists/progress-highlights.html">timeline</a> of its efforts. Recently, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/davide-sabbadin-34b5403a_hackaton-covid-sars-activity-6647895532851249152-xQz8">a hackathon</a> was announced. The MoonShot group announced the closure of the <a href="https://twitter.com/covid_moonshot/status/1243702399526563840">first wave of structure design submissions</a>. Candidates from this set have <a href="https://twitter.com/covid_moonshot/status/1242895527596797952">been selected</a>, and samples have been requested from supplier Enamine. Results (of unspecified type) are to be posted <a href="https://covid.postera.ai/covid">here</a>.</p>
<p>A recent <a href="https://cen.acs.org/pharmaceuticals/drug-discovery/Crystal-structures-novel-coronavirus-protease/98/web/2020/03">C&amp;EN Article</a> mentions the MoonShot project. <a href="http://practicalcheminformatics.blogspot.com/2020/03/building-on-fragments-from-diamondxchem.html">Pat Walters</a> and <a href="https://cheminf20.org/2020/03/28/cheminformatics-from-quarantine-some-interactive-covid-19-resources/">Alex Clark</a> have recently begun writing about techniques for working with the available data.</p>
<h1 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h1>
<p>It&rsquo;s early days for the COVID Moonshot. Even so, I don&rsquo;t recall any project quite like it. If you have a background in or inclination toward molecular design, the project may be worth your time.</p>
<p>Having worked in drug discovery as a medicinal chemist for many years, however, I can&rsquo;t help but thinking about the steps following design and compound synthesis. In vitro assays, probably with recombinant enzyme, will be a vital component of any successful project. For a relatively unexplored target such as SARS-CoV-2 M<!-- raw HTML omitted -->pro<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, in vitro assay throughput could become a bottleneck. It&rsquo;s not clear how the MoonShot will address the problem of in vitro assays, and a <a href="https://twitter.com/rapodaca/status/1243356536287531009">request for information I sent by Twitter</a> remains unanswered. That&rsquo;s just the start of the labor and expense. The project is going to need resources in DMPK/ADME, not to mention functional animal models. It will also need an information technology infrastructure, as the limits of simple websites and Twitter already begin to surface. The there&rsquo;s the thorny problem of intellectual property, particularly among participants who also work in industry. These and many other challenges could help shape new models for running drug discovery programs.</p>
<p>Crises have a way of making previously unthinkable leaps into the unknown possible.</p>
<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
<p>The COVID MoonShot is a loose association of institutions and individuals organized around the goal of finding a practical COVID-19 treatment. Current efforts are focused on SARS-CoV-2 M<!-- raw HTML omitted -->pro<!-- raw HTML omitted --> inhibitors, but I suspect that could change as new information emerges. Regardless of your scientific background or skills, the project is worth exploring.</p>
