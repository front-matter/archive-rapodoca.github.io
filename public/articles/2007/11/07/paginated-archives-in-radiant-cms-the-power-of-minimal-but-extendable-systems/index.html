<p><a href="http://radiantcms.org">Radiant CMS</a> is one of those systems. As an added bonus, it&rsquo;s written in Ruby and built on <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Rails</a>. Radiant succeeds by focusing on the management of pages while providing a powerful extension mechanism.</p>
<p>The Website for my company, <a href="http://metamolecular.com">Metamolecular</a>, will consist of content produced infrequently (product descriptions and documentation) intermingled with more frequently created blog-like content (updates, tutorials, responses to user questions). Traditionally, the CMS has handled the former, with blogging software handling the latter. But we needed a system that handled both well.</p>
<p>One of the distinguishing characteristics of blogs, as opposed to other kinds of websites, is the unusually large number of similar pages. Handling this kind of content requires pagination - the ability to break an archive up into a series of pages containing a smaller subset of the archive.</p>
<p>Although Radiant doesn&rsquo;t have the ability to paginate its content, it does have a wonderful system for creating extensions. I thought I&rsquo;d give it a try.</p>
<p>The result is the Paginated Archive extension. It works as a drop-in replacement for Radiant&rsquo;s existing Archive Page. After placing the extension into your PROJECT_HOME/vendor/extensions directory, you&rsquo;ll be able to create and configure Paginated Archives for use with blogs and other kinds of sites generating large numbers of pages. The extension requires Bruce Williams&rsquo; excellent <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/paginator">Paginator</a> gem.</p>
<p>You can get started by downloading the extension <a href="/images/posts/20071107/paginated_archive.tar.gz">here</a>.</p>
