    <title>The Business Case for Open Source and the Small Company | Depth-First</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1">
    <meta name="description" content="Few would argue against small companies using open source software - indeed many owe their very existence to it. But what real, tangible good can come from a small company releasing open source software?
Signal to Noise, the company blog of 37signals, offers a worthwhile perspective on this issue. To summarize the business case:

Certain kinds of software, like infrastructure software, take vast amounts of time and resources to get right - something that few small companies can afford. Open sourcing can accelerate the process.
Open sourcing provides a public arena in which your own company&rsquo;s developers can learn from other great developers.
That public arena provides unique access to a pool of smart, motivated developers - and offers a way to evaluate their work before even deciding to interview them.
Open source generates press attention and goodwill from potential customers.

But what real, tangible good can come from a small company <em>releasing</em> open source software?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/693-ask-37signals-how-has-open-source-helped-or-hindered">Signal to Noise</a>, the company blog of <a href="http://37signals.com">37signals</a>, offers a worthwhile perspective on this issue. To summarize the business case:</p>
<ul>
<li>Certain kinds of software, like infrastructure software, take vast amounts of time and resources to get right - something that few small companies can afford. Open sourcing can accelerate the process.</li>
<li>Open sourcing provides a public arena in which your own company&rsquo;s developers can learn from other great developers.</li>

<p>And about the elephant in the room:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A big fear that a lot of people have is that they’ll somehow be giving away their secret sauce. Unless your actual product is what you’re open sourcing, it really doesn&rsquo;t matter (and there are even plenty of examples of that working well). It’s unlikely that the piece of code that’s only seen internal development is such a silver bullet that you’re going to outshine your competition by its use alone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="/articles/2006/11/06/stone-soup">distinction</a> between infrastructure software and a company&rsquo;s secret sauce is particularly important.</p>
<p>By just about any standard, 37signals is a leader in the deliberate use of open source software to achieve business objectives. We can all learn from them.</p>
