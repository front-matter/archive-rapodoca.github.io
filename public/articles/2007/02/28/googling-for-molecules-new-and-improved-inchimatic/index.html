<p>There are noticeable differences in the abilities of search engines other than Google to find InChIs. Google seems to offer the most complete coverage. For example, all search engines I&rsquo;ve tried have returned either a subset or recapitulation of Google&rsquo;s results.</p>
<p>One of the most striking things about InChIMatic is how specific the search results are. Every molecule that has produced results for me has been a direct hit. Also notable is how few InChIs are currently indexed by Google and other search engines. Tackling that problem will require a convenient and unobtrusive way to get InChIs into Web pages and to get those pages indexed by search engines. But more on that later.</p>
