<p>Given the two previous articles on axial chirality, it should be clear how to represent the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->two enantiomers<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->enantiomers of the structure<!-- raw HTML omitted --> shown above using FlexMol. What is far from clear at this point is how to bring this capability to chemists. For example, no 2-D structure editor I&rsquo;m aware of can systematically encode axial chirality. Likewise, no 2-D rendering toolkit can draw it. FlexMol and languages like it are important first steps to solving these problems, but they are by no means the last.</p>
<p><em>Postscript: the two structures depicted above are actually identical! You can prove this to yourself by verifying that the phenol oxygen points into the plane of your screen and the chlorine atom points out of the plane in both structures. Clearly the authors intended for the phenyl ring to be flipped by 180 degrees, but they hand-placed the wedges on the wrong side of the benzene ring. The fact that this error appears in none other than J. Med. Chem. further underscores the need for tools that understand axial chirality.</em></p>
