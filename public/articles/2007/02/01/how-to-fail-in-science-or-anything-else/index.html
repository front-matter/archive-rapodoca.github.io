<p>What are the most reliable ways to fail in science? Of course, no scientist sets out to fail, but an understanding of that path can lead to a better understanding of the path to success.</p>
<p>By way of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Seth Godin&rsquo;s Blog<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I came across some interesting <!-- raw HTML omitted -->rules for failure<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Seth&rsquo;s article cites the above quoted essay. Its author is a self-styled &ldquo;amateur researcher.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t necessarily subscribe to everything written, but his essay contains more than a few grains of truth.</p>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;re looking for good ways to fail in science, here are some starting points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t tell anyone about your idea - they might steal it.</li>
<li>When you do tell (shame on you!), don&rsquo;t listen to negative feedback - nobody knows your idea like you.</li>
<li>Focus on selling your idea to the government or a big company - this is your ticket to fame and fortune!</li>
<li>Assume other scientists will be blown away by your discovery - the ones that don&rsquo;t get it are incompetent.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t bother to build a working prototype - it&rsquo;s a waste of time. If, for some reason, you do build one, keep it under lock and key (see rule 1).</li>
<li>Notebooks and record keeping are busywork - focus on real work instead. Like coming up with more ideas.</li>
</ul>
<p>Scientists showing these symptoms probably suffer from the mistaken belief that ideas are more important than hard work. Thomas Edison&rsquo;s remark about success being 99% execution and 1% idea couldn&rsquo;t be more true today. Ideas are cheap. People with the determination, ability, and humility to make their ideas work are the precious commodity.</p>
