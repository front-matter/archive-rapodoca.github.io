<p>The number of peer-reviewed publications using the Open Source Java library <a href="http://cdk.sf.net">Chemistry Development Kit</a> (CDK) just keeps growing. The latest addition comes by way of a paper by Fechner and Schneider on ligand-based de novo design. In many areas, Open Source software is used not because it&rsquo;s free, but because it&rsquo;s perceived as superior to alternatives. How long will it be before this is true in cheminformatics?</p>
