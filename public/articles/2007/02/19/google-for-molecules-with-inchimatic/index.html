After drawing your structure in the editor window, click the &ldquo;InChI!&rdquo; button to get a link. This link takes you to a Google query that displays matches for your molecule. You&rsquo;ll need both Java and JavaScript enabled in your browser to use InChIMatic.</p>
<h1 id="the-technical-details">The Technical Details</h1>
<p>The technology at the heart of InChIMatic is the <a href="http://www.iupac.org/inchi/">IUPAC International Chemical Identifier</a> (InChI). An InChI is an alphanumeric string that uniquely identifies a molecular structure. By converting molecular structures to text, InChI makes it easy to use standard Internet tools to do exact structure searches.</p>
<p>The earliest reference in the peer-reviewed literature to using Google for searching InChIs is contained in a <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b502828k">2005 paper</a>. More recently, a service called <a href="http://querychem.com">QueryChem</a> has taken this idea one step further by using the <a href="http://code.google.com/">Google API</a> to perform substructure searches based on InChI.</p>
<p>InChIMatic works differently. Unlike a raw Google search, InChIMatic builds a Google query link for you. Unlike QueryChem, InChIMatic doesn&rsquo;t use the Google API and so has none of its restrictions. This does result in a limitation: InChIMatic can only currently be used to for exact structure queries.</p>
<p>The InChIMatic Web application has been discussed in greater technical detail in a <a href="http://depth-first.com/articles/2006/12/15/anatomy-of-a-cheminformatics-web-application-inchimatic">previous article</a>. The rapid Web application development framework <a href="http://rubyonrails.com">Ruby on Rails</a> made building InChIMatic a snap. InChIMatic is served by the Ruby application container <a href="http://depth-first.com/articles/2007/02/05/mongrel-and-rails-its-just-not-fair">Mongrel</a>, which is hosted on a Linux server running Apache. <a href="http://depth-first.com/articles/tag/rino">Rino</a> provided the Ruby interface to the <a href="http://www.iupac.org/inchi/">IUPAC/NIST InChI toolkit</a>. The 2-D structure editor is <a href="http://www.molinspiration.com/jme/">Java Molecular Editor</a> (JME) by Peter Ertl, which is used with his kind permission.</p>
<p>Aside from JME, all components of InChIMatic, from the operating system it runs on to the InChI system itself, are <a href="http://opensource.org">Open Source</a> software.</p>
<h1 id="using-inchi-to-raise-the-visibility-of-your-content">Using InChI to Raise the Visibility of Your Content</h1>
<p>InChIMatic returns many Google results for common molecules. But less common, known molecules return no hits at all. Three factors are responsible: (1) Google doesn&rsquo;t index all InChIs on the Internet; (2) few content providers currently use InChI; and (3) there is no standard and convenient mechanism to embed InChIs into Web pages for indexing by Google.</p>
<p>For these reasons, I consider InChI to be bleeding edge technology. Some will find it useful, most will not. Unfortunately, this state of affairs will persist until problems (1) and (3) are solved.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if you&rsquo;re technically adventurous, InChIMatic offers a relatively painless way to begin incorporating InChIs into your content and verifying that they get indexed. There&rsquo;s no software to download, install, or upgrade. Forget about operating system incompatibilities (hopefully!). Just point your Java-enabled browser to <a href="http://inchimatic.com">inchimatic.com</a>.</p>
<p>Although there&rsquo;s no standard method to encode InChIs in Web pages, some interesting ideas have been put forward. <a href="http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/">Egon Willighagen</a> has proposed <a href="http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2006/12/including-smiles-cml-and-inchi-in.html">a system</a> based on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-primer/">RDFa</a>. Future iterations of InChIMatic may include support for generating scripts and/or markup for including InChIs into blogs and other online content.</p>
<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
<p>InChI is a complex new technology in need of easy-to-use tools. InChIMatic is one such tool that makes it possible to perform exact structure queries using Google.</p>
<p>One of the exciting things about Web applications is how quickly they can evolve. If in trying out InChIMatic you find something you&rsquo;d like changed or added, please feel free to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->write me<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
