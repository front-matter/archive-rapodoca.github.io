<li><strong>If you&rsquo;re writing about anything remotely interesting, you will be identified sooner or later.</strong> Have you ever attended a scientific meeting and noticed how many perfect strangers you meet who know someone you know? Scientific disciplines are very small worlds. Not only that, but Google is a frighteningly powerful tool to find obscure information. If one of your colleagues stumbles onto your blog, chances are excellent they will be able to identify you if they&rsquo;re determined.</li>
<li><strong>Owning your content keeps you sane.</strong> Have you ever noticed how otherwise considerate people can be very inconsiderate drivers? There&rsquo;s something about anonymity that brings out the worst in people. Connecting your name with what you write forces you to carefully consider what you&rsquo;re doing. And that&rsquo;s a good thing. You&rsquo;re going to be identified anyway (see above), so you might as well write like it from the start.</li>
<li><strong>Consider your motive.</strong> What&rsquo;s the real reason you&rsquo;re writing under a pseudonym? Is it to be able to vent without consequence? To avoid upsetting your boss? Wanting to avoid colleague reactions or embarrassment? Uncertainty as to whether you&rsquo;re &ldquo;allowed?&rdquo; Do you worry about writing something that a future employer might not like, thus <a href="http://depth-first.com/articles/2007/08/03/advice-to-job-seekers-from-c-e-news-blog-thyself">endangering you chances of getting a job</a>? Going back to Point 1 above, you will be identified eventually. When that happens, will you be prepared to face the music?</li>
<li><strong>Your current employer has rights.</strong> If you&rsquo;re working in industry, you&rsquo;ve signed an agreement that gives your employer rights to your ideas and inventions. If you&rsquo;re in academics, your advisor probably doesn&rsquo;t want you disclosing the details of cutting-edge research. The immediacy and reach of blogging will <a href="http://depth-first.com/articles/2007/07/16/go-west-young-man-does-open-access-really-matter-in-the-long-run">turn scientific publication on its head</a>;  these are merely previews of the issues that lie ahead. When in doubt, ask before blogging.</li>
<li><strong>It&rsquo;s a new form of scientific publication.</strong> Would you want to be an anonymous author on your scientific publications? Of course not. Every scientist is a businessperson, whether they like the idea or not. The business model is simple: trade your scientific reputation for money in the form of grants, salaries, bonuses, and job opportunities. Publication is the currency of scientific business. Blog-like scientific writing is simply its newest incarnation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Own your content. The career you help (or save) may be your own.</p>
