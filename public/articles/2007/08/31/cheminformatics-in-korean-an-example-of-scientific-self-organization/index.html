<p>During this process, none of the usual scientific protocols have been observed: no journal articles were written or published; no grants to do any of the work were prepared or funded; no presentations were made; and no central authority was involved (at least on my end). In fact, if any of these conventions had been observed, the work would have never seen the light of day. Free tools, free services, and open standards enabled one scientist to connect with another in a way that&rsquo;s impossible to achieve through conventional means.</p>
