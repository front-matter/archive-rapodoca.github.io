This article generated some interest among developers. For example, <a href="http://baoilleach.blogspot.com">Noel O&rsquo;Boyle</a> posted code for <a href="http://baoilleach.blogspot.com/2007/08/access-embedded-molecular-information.html">reading PNG image metadata with Python</a>. The popularity of Python in cheminformatics makes this approach especially attractive.</p>
<p>But how would you write PNG image metadata with Python? The obvious answer of using <code>Image.info</code> followed by <code>Image.write</code> doesn&rsquo;t appear to work. Given my limited knowledge of Python, the answer must come from elsewhere.</p>
<p>Fortunately, <a href="http://blog.modp.com/">Nick Galbreath</a> wrote in to offer a solution. Using Python, <a href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/">PIL</a>, and an undocumented class, Nick has developed <a href="http://blog.modp.com/2007/08/python-pil-and-png-metadata-take-2.html">a small wrapper function</a> that writes metadata for PNG images. In fact, Nick is <a href="http://blog.modp.com/2007/08/png-metadata-from-command-line-again.html">fast on his way</a> to becoming a PNG metadata expert, if reluctantly so. His blog is worth checking out and contains several useful techniques for image manipulation.</p>
