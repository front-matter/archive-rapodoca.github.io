<p><img src="/images/posts/20070801/rosiglitazone.png" alt="Rosiglitazone" title="Rosiglitazone"></p>
<p>A <a href="/articles/2007/08/01/never-draw-the-same-molecule-twice-image-metadata-for-cheminformatics">recent D-F article</a> proposed a method to encode molecular structure data within commonly-used Web image formats such as PNG. That article contained an embedded image of GlaxoSmithKline&rsquo;s diabetes treatment rosiglitazone (Avandia) encoded by a rendering toolkit built with <a href="/articles/tag/firefly">Firefly</a>. I claimed that this image contained the complete connection table and atom coordinates as embedded metadata. In this article, I&rsquo;ll show a simple method to read this metadata.</p>
<p>Metadata is a standard part of the PNG specification; to read it requires nothing more than software capable of recognizing it. I recently found a Web-based, cross-platform method for doing so. The <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/convert/image/metadata.htm">Image Metadata Viewer</a> by <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/index.htm">FileFormat.info</a> accepts an uploaded image file and returns that image&rsquo;s metadata. Let&rsquo;s try it with the image of rosiglitazone.</p>
<p>After saving the image to my hard drive, uploading it to FileFormat.info and pressing start, I can see that the image contains metadata:</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/20070808-2/screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot" title="Screenshot"></p>
<p>The metadata can be viewed either as XML or as plain text. Choosing plain text (second option) gives me the complete molfile, stored as a key/value hash (molfile=[molfile]).</p>
<p>Clearly, reading metadata is not a problem given the right software. But this leaves the question of how metadata is encoded in the first place - especially in a programming language such as Java. Like everything else, it&rsquo;s not difficult when you know how. Stay tuned for the answer.</p>
