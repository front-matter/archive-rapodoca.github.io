The product, AurScope (link discontinued), consists of a curated database of biological screening results divided into categories including GPCRs, Kinases, Ion Channels, ADME, and hERG. Searches can be performed by structure or activity at a target. Aureus offers AurSCOPE in a few configurations - the one I saw demoed was a stand-alone client.

The problem is not finding it; the problem is putting it all together. A company called <a href="http://www.aureus-sciences.com">Aureus Sciences</a> has stepped into this void by offering a product aimed directly at collating and mining published biological screening data.</p>
<p>The product, <a href="http://www.aureus-pharma.com/Pages/Products/Aurscope.php">AurScope</a> (link discontinued), consists of a curated database of biological screening results divided into categories including GPCRs, Kinases, Ion Channels, ADME, and hERG. Searches can be performed by structure or activity at a target. Aureus offers AurSCOPE in a few configurations - the one I saw demoed was a stand-alone client. Apparently, Aureus also offers AurSCOPE as a stripped-down database that can be integrated within a drug discovery organization&rsquo;s existing IT infrastructure, presenting some very interesting possibilities for medicinal chemists looking to exploit competitor data or work around selectivity problems.</p>
<p>One of the more interesting aspects about AurSCOPE is the way it&rsquo;s produced. Like <a href="/articles/2007/08/28/sciencehack-youtube-meets-chemistry">ScienceHack</a>, AurSCOPE is built with people-power. Although the company wouldn&rsquo;t give exact numbers, Aureus&rsquo; representatives did say that it employed a number of trained scientists to cull the biological screening results making up AurSCOPE from published sources.</p>
<p>Competitive intelligence and target selectivity are omnipresent concerns in drug discovery. Products like AurSCOPE can fill important needs in these areas. Although it wasn&rsquo;t clear how AurSCOPE handles the (not uncommon) situation in which two labs report numbers based on different screening protocols at the same target, the product seems to have a lot going for it. Given the vast wealth of disjointed data contained in the published chemical literature, Aureus&rsquo; approach of using trained scientists to assemble it into something greater than the sum of its parts is well worth keeping in mind.</p>
