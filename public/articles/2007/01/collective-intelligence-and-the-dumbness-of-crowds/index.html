<p>&ldquo;Web 2.0&rdquo; has gotten a lot of people thinking about exciting new forms of collaboration made possible through the Internet. Services like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Digg<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->YouTube<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Flickr<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wikipedia<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and especially the way they harness the selfish impulses of individuals for the common good, are seen by many as just the start of even better things to come.</p>
<p>Given the astonishing advances in hardware made possible by Moore&rsquo;s law, and the relentless progress of Open Source software, starting one of these services on your own can be done for practically nothing. Of course, starting a Web 2.0 service and actually seeing it become a raging success are two very different things. What&rsquo;s the deciding factor?</p>
<p>It was while thinking about this question that I ran across a thought-provoking article on Kathy Sierra&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Creating Passionate Users<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Although mainly focused on software, Kathy&rsquo;s blog is essential reading for anyone trying to create remarkable products. The article that caught my eye was titled <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;The &lsquo;Dumbness of Crowds&rsquo;&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. In it, Kathy makes some interesting distinctions between &ldquo;Collective Intelligence&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dumbness of Crowds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The distinction arises from the number of people involved, the nature of what they&rsquo;re building together, and the process by which differing views are reconciled. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collective Intelligence</strong> a bunch of people writing Amazon book reviews</li>
<li><strong>Dumbness of Crowds</strong> a bunch of people using a Wiki to write a book</li>
<li><strong>Collective Intelligence</strong> - Flickr&rsquo;s photo collection and tags</li>
<li><strong>Dumbness of Crowds</strong> - a bunch of people trying to make a photo together</li>
</ul>
<p>I could add my own observations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collective Intelligence</strong> an online RSS aggregator that combines blog feeds from multiple sources within the community</li>
<li><strong>Dumbness of Crowds</strong>   a publicly-writable Wiki that serves as your community&rsquo;s public face</li>
<li><strong>Collective Intelligence</strong> ten users of an Open Source software library stress-testing it in their own work, fixing bugs, and requesting features</li>
<li><strong>Dumbness of Crowds</strong> ten programmers trying to design an API</li>
<li><strong>Collective Intelligence</strong> ten developers who each start their own project to build their own distinct application based on a piece of Open Source software</li>
<li><strong>Dumbness of Crowds</strong> ten developers who set out to design a single application that does the work of ten</li>
</ul>
<p>The distinction really revolves around the degree to which individual contributions are blindly averaged verses being allowed to retain their individuality. Committees rarely create great works. Even worse - sometimes consensus is fatal.</p>
