<blockquote>

<p>Use <a href="http://cmldprotocols.bu.edu/cmld/ViewPublicReactionList.jsp">this link</a> to begin exploring their service. To date the CMLD-BU has deposited <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?term=%22CMLD-BU%22%5Bsourcename%5D&amp;cmd=search&amp;db=pcsubstance">just over 1,600</a> Substances with <a href="http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">PubChem</a> and their site shows 125 reaction protocols.</p>
<p>Although CMLD-BU&rsquo;s user interface could use some tweaking, their content is right on the money: real examples of preparative reactions with links to the primary literature and even spectral data.</p>
<p>Are we at the end of this process or at the beginning? Only time will tell. But the nearly <a href="/articles/2006/09/03/peculiarities-of-chemical-information">infinite shelflife</a> and ubiquity of chemical information coupled with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=16427261">inexorable approach</a> of virtually zero-cost computer services leaves only one of those two possibilities worthy of serious consideration.</p>
