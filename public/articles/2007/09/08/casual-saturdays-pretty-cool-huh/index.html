In the process, I&rsquo;ve come across a lot of weird, funny, or just plain cool things online - most of which have little or nothing to do with chemistry or chemical informatics. Given that readers take the weekend off, I thought it might be fun to share the things I&rsquo;m finding here every Saturday. Enjoy!">
