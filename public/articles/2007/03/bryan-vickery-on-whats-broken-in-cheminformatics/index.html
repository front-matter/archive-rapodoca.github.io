</blockquote>
<p>Bryan Vickery&rsquo;s interview is interesting on a number of levels, not the least of which being that it appears in an ACS publication. His comments raise the obvious question of <em>why</em> does the academic/research community continue to support existing publishing models, complaints notwithstanding. The answer to this question is the key to fixing what&rsquo;s broken.</p>
