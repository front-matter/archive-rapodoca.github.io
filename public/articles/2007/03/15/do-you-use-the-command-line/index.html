<p>The command line is alive and well. It&rsquo;s simply become so sophisticated that most of us don&rsquo;t realize we&rsquo;re using it. Whether we&rsquo;re entering a URL into a browser address bar, taking advantage of autocomplete to look up a co-worker&rsquo;s name in an address book, or using Google to search the Web, the command line is hard at work. Most people wouldn&rsquo;t want it any other way.</p>
<p>To an end user, a command line is nothing more than a box to enter text. The magic happens when this text is processed. Aza Raskin&rsquo;s company <a href="http://humanized.com">Humanized</a> uses this simple idea to build text-driven applications that save time and effort.</p>
<p>What would happen if the same thinking were applied to chemical informatics?</p>
