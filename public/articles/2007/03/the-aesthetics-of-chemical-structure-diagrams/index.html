Many of them have become so refined and integral to the practice of chemistry that they no longer seem like mere tools.

<p>Two-dimensional chemical structure diagrams are a language with both grammar and aesthetics. For example, if you draw pentavalent carbon, you&rsquo;ve probably made a grammatical mistake. Aesthetics come into play when a grammatically-correct structure doesn&rsquo;t readily make sense because it uses unfamiliar drawing conventions such as strange bond angles, random bond lengths, unusual orientations, or atom labels that are too small. If you&rsquo;ve ever worked in an interdisciplinary environment where non-chemists draw structures (god bless &rsquo;em for trying), you&rsquo;ve probably experienced the importance of structure aesthetics.</p>
<p>Two recent publications attempt to formalize the aesthetic qualities of good chemical structure diagrams. One deals with <a href="http://www.iupac.org/reports/provisional/abstract07/brecher_300607.html">chemical structures in general</a>, and the other focuses <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1351/pac200678101897">specifically on stereochemistry</a>. The first document is a draft recommendation on which comments will be accepted until June 30, 2007.</p>
<p>Two long-term trends are raising the importance of standards in this area: (1) structures are increasingly being generated by software without any human guidance, as in the case of <a href="http://depth-first.com/articles/2006/10/17/from-iupac-nomenclature-to-2-d-structures-with-opsin">chemical nomenclature translation</a>; and (2) in a <a href="http://depth-first.com/articles/2006/12/27/the-chemical-information-world-is-flat">flat chemical information world</a> in which new scientific publishing models come into being, journal editors will no longer have the final say in how structures are rendered.</p>
<p>The best tools don&rsquo;t just solve a technical problem - they make their users happy. Although aesthetic qualities can be difficult to define, they matter at least as much as technical correctness. Chemical structure diagrams are no exception.</p>
