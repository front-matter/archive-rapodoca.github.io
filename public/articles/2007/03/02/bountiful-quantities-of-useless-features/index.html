<p>When building software, the temptation to add nifty but useless features can be very strong. This temptation becomes almost irresistible when a clear vision of the final product is missing. What separates software that people <em>love</em> to use from software that people <em>have</em> to use? In many cases, it&rsquo;s the discipline to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to feature blight.</p>
