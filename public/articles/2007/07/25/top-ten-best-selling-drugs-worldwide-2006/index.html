A list of chemical names and numbers by itself is not that useful. However, adding chemical structures has a way of prompting better questions and generating many more ideas.

<p>A new software package codenamed &ldquo;Firefly&rdquo; was used to generate the chemical structures in the table. Firefly is a lightweight 2D editor and rendering library written in Java. A series of articles on Firefly can be found on Depth-First.</p>
