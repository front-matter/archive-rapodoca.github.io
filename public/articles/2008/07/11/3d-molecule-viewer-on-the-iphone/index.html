<p>So, what can the iPhone do for chemistry?</p>
<p>One answer comes from <a href="http://www.sunsetlakesoftware.com/about">Brad Larson</a>, software developer and founder of <a href="http://www.sunsetlakesoftware.com/">Sunset Lake Software</a>. His software, <a href="http://www.sunsetlakesoftware.com/molecules">Molecules</a>, can display a variety of 3D molecular representations on the iPhone. As you might expect for software running on the iPhone, the view can be manipulated with touch screen gestures like two-finger pinch to zoom. Data can be pulled directly from the <a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb">PDB</a>.</p>
<p>The author plans to release the Molecules source code under the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php">BSD License</a>, pending approval from Apple.</p>
