    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>If publications are the front porch of science, dissertations and theses are its basement. Virtually every bit of information that makes its way into a scientific paper can also be found in some form in a thesis or dissertation. But theses and dissertations also hold vast quantities of information that never made it into a publication: the experiment that failed for no identifiable reason; lines of what was considered at the time dead-end investigation; one-off experiments that don&rsquo;t reach the level of minimum publishable unit; and varying degrees of speculation.</p>
<p>And like many basements, science&rsquo;s basement has been in desperate need of spring cleaning for years.</p>
<p>Collectively, working with theses and dissertations has been much more difficult than working with publications. For starters, they&rsquo;re not indexed as well or comprehensively as papers. And even if you manage to find the abstract to a dissertation that looks like it contains something important, getting your hands on a copy can be challenging at best.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.scientificcommons.org/">Scientific Commons</a> is a service aimed at, among other goals, making it easier to work with dissertations. This remarkably low-key service has gathered references to over 20 million scholarly publications by over 8 million authors in over 900 repositories worldwide. These documents can be searched by keyword, and search results can be filtered by year and language, and sorted by relevance or year.</p>
<p>Although many of the documents contained in Scientific Commons are dissertations and theses, many are manuscripts for papers. This figures prominently in another of Scientific Commons&rsquo; goals: to make visible the relationship between authors and their published works.</p>
<p>For example, we can <a href="http://en.scientificcommons.org/sylvester_j_sanfilippo#search_string=heterocycle">search the term &lsquo;heterocycle&rsquo;</a>, find <a href="http://en.scientificcommons.org/17162871">this paper</a>, and then click on <a href="http://en.scientificcommons.org/john_r_nichols">this author&rsquo;s name</a> to get a listing of his papers.</p>
<p>One of the limitations of Scientific Commons appears to be <a href="http://en.scientificcommons.org/register-repository">a high barrier</a> to adding content. If you run a repository, it must meet strict requirements to work with Scientific Commons. If you have personal content, it must <a href="http://en.scientificcommons.org/help">meet other requirements</a>.</p>
<p>Scientific Commons has taken a big step to cleaning up science&rsquo;s basement. The job isn&rsquo;t finished by a long shot, but the service hints at what might be possible.</p>
