His creation, <a href="http://goeslightly.blogspot.com/2008/04/campdepict-jruby-cdk-and-camping.html">CampDepict</a>, interactively produces a raster image of a 2D chemical structure given a SMILES string, not unlike <a href="http://www.daylight.com/daycgi/depict">Daylight&rsquo;s Depict application</a>.</p>
<p>CampDepict uses the Ruby Web microframework <a href="http://redhanded.hobix.com/bits/campingAMicroframework.html">Camping</a>. From the <a href="http://camping.rubyforge.org/files/README.html">README</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Camping is a web framework which consistently stays at less than 4kb of code. You can probably view the complete source code on a single page. But, you know, it‘s so small that, if you think about it, what can it really do?</p>
<p>The idea here is to store a complete fledgling web application in a single file like many small CGIs. But to organize it as a Model-View-Controller application like Rails does. You can then easily move it to Rails once you‘ve got it going.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>John&rsquo;s application is loosely-based on the <a href="http://depth-first.com/articles/2006/12/04/anatomy-of-a-cheminformatics-web-application-ajaxifying-depict">Rails Depict</a> application first described in 2006 here on Depth-First. His code makes use of <a href="http://cdk.sf.net">CDK</a> and <a href="http://sf.net/projects/structure">Structure CDK</a>, and it runs on <a href="http://jruby.codehaus.org/">JRuby</a>.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever been curious about what Ruby has to offer cheminformatics, CampDepict could be just the application to get your feet wet.</p>
