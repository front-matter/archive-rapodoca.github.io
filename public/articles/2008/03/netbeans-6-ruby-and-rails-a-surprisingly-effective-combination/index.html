Getting started with Ruby, Rails and NetBeans is as easy as downloading the installer and running it.

Although <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/">NetBeans</a> may not spring to mind when thinking of Rails IDEs, it should be at the top of the list for anyone interested in the subject.</p>
<p>Getting started with Ruby, Rails and NetBeans is as easy as <a href="http://download.netbeans.org/netbeans/6.0/final/">downloading the installer</a> and running it. If you later decide to add Java support to your installation (which is also excellent), that can be done by downloading and running the <a href="http://download.netbeans.org/netbeans/6.0/final/">Java installer</a>. You&rsquo;ll end up with a single IDE that supports both languages.</p>
<h1 id="code-completion">Code Completion</h1>
<p>Although other IDEs support some form of Ruby code completion, NetBeans takes it to another level. Can&rsquo;t remember the exact name of the method you&rsquo;re looking for? Type the period and let NetBeans look up both the name and documentation for you:</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/20080326/code_completion.png" alt="Code Completion" title="Code Completion"></p>
<p>Hitting return enters the method and creates a template for parameters and any needed blocks.</p>
<h1 id="refactoring">Refactoring</h1>
<p>One of the things that makes Java such a powerful language for large projects is the refactoring support offered by most IDEs. NetBeans brings this power to Ruby. Need to rename a class, method, or variable? Let NetBeans do it for you:</p>

<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
<p>There&rsquo;s much more to NetBeans 6 and Ruby/Rails than what&rsquo;s been shown here, including formatting/highlighting for JavaScript and CSS, user-definable Ruby/JRuby interpreter, and menu-based script execution. Whether you&rsquo;re looking for a way to get started with using Ruby and Rails or a way to become more efficient at it, NetBeans 6 is well worth the time.</p>
