Here are some responses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) HTML vs PDF: does anyone read the HTML articles? Do you read the PDF on-screen or print it out?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used PDFs both for offline archiving and sharing of especially important articles as well as one-off printing of a paper I&rsquo;m interested in. I rarely read a paper on-screen if I can avoid it.</p>
<p>Typical workflow: (1) download PDF; (2) print it out; (3); let paper sit while I go do something in the lab that can&rsquo;t wait (or bring it with me); (4) put paper onto a rather large stack of papers just like it; (5) pull paper out of stack from time to time as needed; (6) (optional) file paper in an increasingly chaotic system of folders or recycle it.</p>
<p>This system is bad, and <a href="/articles/2007/03/22/why-i-still-dont-use-connotea">I cursed it weekly during my time as a research chemist</a>. Most of my colleagues had similar experiences.</p>
<p>There are plenty of opportunities to address pain points with the Web. Some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make it <em>very</em> easy to find papers on the <em>Nature Chemistry</em> site. If I know a paper is trivial to find, I&rsquo;m less likely to print it out in the first place. Good search may not be enough (see question 3).</li>
<li>Make the online version as readable as it can be. Minimize fluff like menus, ads and general clutter. Maximize things that promote readability like reasonable column-widths, appropriate fonts, and attractive and readable images.</li>
<li>Add conveniences that make it easier to read the paper online such as hover-popups that display 2D chemical structures for trivial names and IUPAC nomenclature (see below).</li>
</ul>
<p>Paper is portable but Web documents are alive. Both can be readable - for example, I never print out a blog posting to read it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(2) Big vs little graphics: what does everyone else think about the tiny size of the graphics in ACS html articles?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Graphics should be sized appropriately. ACS HTML articles are a good example of failing to <a href="/articles/2007/09/28/designing-the-obvious">design the obvious</a>. You&rsquo;d never read a blog post that looked like those articles, so it&rsquo;s not surprising everyone prints out the PDF.</p>
<p>Another problem is over-wide columns. It&rsquo;s puzzling why journal publishers would ignore all of their hard-won design experience just because a document appears as a Web page. If the ACS used a narrower column width, the Web version would be more readable. For example, check out <a href="http://www.beilstein-journals.org/bjoc/single/articleFullText.htm?vt=f&amp;publicId=1860-5397-4-2&amp;bpn=latest&amp;dos=0">this article</a> from <a href="http://www.beilstein-journals.org/bjoc"><em>Beilstein Journal of Organic Chemistry</em></a>. The only thing I&rsquo;d change is to make the font larger.</p>
<p>Both problems are correctable using the right software and techniques.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(3) Tagging/’semantic web’: what do you think about the toys on the RSC’s Project Prospect? What kind of things would you like to see tagged/linked to other content in Nature Chemistry? For instance, Steve would love to do something with named reactions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If by tagging, you mean giving users the ability to tag articles like <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a> allows photos to be tagged, and for other users to make use of those tags while searching, I think it&rsquo;s <a href="/articles/2007/01/18/collective-intelligence-and-the-dumbness-of-crowds">long overdue and could be a game-changer</a>. It would clearly play to the strength of the Web as a medium.</p>
<p>I must confess that I&rsquo;m not a fan of the implementation of <a href="http://www.rsc.org/Publishing/Journals/ProjectProspect/FAQ.asp">Project Prospect</a>, although the idea has a lot going for it. There&rsquo;s too much bling and a lot of it fails on my Linux/Firefox 2 system.</p>
<p>The one Prospect feature well worth adapting would be the one that lets you get a 2D structure by clicking on a trivial name or IUPAC name. But there&rsquo;s a much better way to implement it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn it on by default and get rid of the floating right-hand menu.</li>
<li>Make the structure appear, without clicking, by simply hovering the mouse over the trivial name or IUPAC nomenclature. Be sure the delay is set right so that it&rsquo;s not popping up unintentionally.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s all there is to it. It needn&rsquo;t be complex, just usable.</p>
<p>Another possibility: harvest all of the 2D molecular structures appearing in articles over a given period of time to be displayed in a dense, hyperlinked <a href="/articles/2006/12/11/hacking-molbank-creating-a-graphical-table-of-contents">graphical abstract format</a> ideal for quick browsing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(4) 3D molecular structures: do these help your understanding of a paper?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rarely, and in many cases they just add clutter. For almost all small molecules, a properly laid-out and well-drawn 2D chemical structure is more useful. If a central point of discussion in a paper is a 3D structure, then that <em>would</em> be a good use of the technology.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(5) How useful to you are InChIs and SMILES?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not very. Research chemists rarely care about this kind of technology. They&rsquo;d much rather have <a href="/articles/2008/02/12/the-art-and-science-of-chemical-structure-diagrams-double-trouble">a good-looking 2D chemical structure</a>. InChIs and SMILES, if available, should be <a href="/articles/2006/09/05/the-automatic-encoding-of-chemical-structures">hidden away and only brought out when requested</a>. A more basic problem is <a href="/articles/tag/flexmol">neither system will be able to encode all of the molecules</a> your journal&rsquo;s authors are likely to discuss.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(6) Forward linking: the RSC and Elsevier/Science Direct offer this - do you use it? Would you use an RSS feed that alerted you to new citations of a particular paper.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It could be useful provided that clutter could be kept to a minimum. It&rsquo;s essentially a form of linkback (see below).</p>
<p>An RSS feed that published linkback activity might be useful, but many of the chemists I know still don&rsquo;t know what RSS is. On the other hand, a page (or email service) that could keep an interested reader updated on linkback activity on all of their papers of interest simultaneously could be very useful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>( 7) Would you actually comment on papers if there was a comments box at the end?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2008/05/re-what-should-nature-chemistry-paper.html">Like Egon Willighagen</a>, I&rsquo;d probably use <a href="">my blog</a> to do it.</p>
<p>However, most chemists don&rsquo;t maintain blogs or other websites and for them I can see how the ability to post comments would be useful.</p>
<p>Both kinds of users could be accommodated through a combination of comments and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkback">linkbacks</a>. Provided that a good spam filtration system were used, this two-pronged approach might be very useful to readers.</p>
<p>Blogs are just the tip of the iceberg, though. Web publication technologies are creating all kinds of opportunities for creating <a href="/articles/2008/05/07/1908-and-all-that-the-long-tail-and-chemistry">highly focused, constantly evolving, collaborative mini-reviews on special topics</a>. Linkbacks would create value for both readers and authors of these mini-reviews as well as forward-thinking scientific publications that embrace them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(8) We really like the Biochemical Society&rsquo;s HTML article style (<a href="http://www.biochemj.org/bj/ev/381/0329/bj3810329_ev.htm">sample one here</a>) - do you?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No. Frames makes that site very difficult to navigate.</p>
<p>It will be very interesting to see how Nature Publishing Group takes advantage of its opportunity to create something unique among chemistry publications. Asking the kinds of questions they&rsquo;re asking now, and doing so in the way they&rsquo;re doing it, shows they&rsquo;re at least on the right track.</p>
