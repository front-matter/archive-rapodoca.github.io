    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>One of the difficulties in viewing 2D chemical structures is that molecules vary in size. In particular, larger molecules become difficult to read when confined to a small section of a screen. This article shows how this problem has been addressed in <a href="http://chempedia.com">Chempedia</a> using the 2D rendering capabilities of the <a href="http://metamolecular.com/chemwriter">ChemWriter</a> package.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/20080519/screen.png" alt="Screen"></p>
<p>As an example, consider Chempedia&rsquo;s entry for <a href="http://chempedia.com/monographs/aluminon">Aluminon</a>. Although the summary box at the right shows the structure for Aluminon, it may not be completely readable due to the large size of the molecule.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, Chempedia has implemented a &ldquo;zoom&rdquo; link for all monographs containing a chemical structure. Clicking on the zoom link for Aluminon gives a magnified, scaled, stretchable, and resizable view of the molecule.</p>
<p>To implement this feature, Chempedia uses the <a href="http://metamolecular.com/chemwriter">ChemWriter</a> <code>PainterApplet</code>. Simply setting the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes of the <a href="http://depth-first.com/articles/2008/03/10/demystifying-java-applets-part-2-dry-deployment-with-the-javay-method"><code>&lt;object&gt;</code> tag</a> to &ldquo;100%&rdquo; gives an applet that resizes itself as the surrounding window is resized.</p>
<p>Implementing a resizable 2D structure image window using AJAX and dynamic images is possible, but would be much more difficult to implement. It could also potentially produce a much higher, and unpredictable demand on server memory, CPU cycles, and bandwidth.</p>
<p>ChemWriter makes it possible for the server to delegate resizable image processing to the client, resulting in a much more responsive feature with minimal effect on the server.</p>
