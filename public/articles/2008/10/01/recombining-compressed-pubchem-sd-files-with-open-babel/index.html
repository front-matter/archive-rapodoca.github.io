<p>You might think about writing some &ldquo;quick&rdquo; code in your language of choice. Fortunately, <a href="http://openbabel.org">Open Babel</a> gets the job done - without any of the coding or debugging.</p>
<p>The following command will create a single SD File from all of the compressed SD Files in a given directory, while also stripping explicit hydrogens and removing all fields except PUBCHEM_COMPOUND_CID.</p>
