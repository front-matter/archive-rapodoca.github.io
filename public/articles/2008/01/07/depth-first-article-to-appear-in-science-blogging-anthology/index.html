    <meta name="description" content="A recent Depth-First article titled &ldquo;SMILES and Aromaticity: Broken?&rdquo; has been selected to appear in the science blogging anthology &ldquo;The Open Laboratory 2007.&rdquo; This article, along with the 51 other winning entries, will be published as a book that can be purchased from Amazon.com. The book, the second in a series, is aimed at promoting the 2008 North Carolina Science Blogging Conference to be held on January 19, 2008.
Are science blogging anthologies like Open Laboratory just a passing fad, or the beginning of something much larger? Only time will tell. What&rsquo;s clear is that the means of production and distribution of scientific information are getting cheaper by the year, resulting in an increasingly large range of choices for readers. If other communication-related industries such as movies, music, software, and newspapers offer any indication of what lies ahead, small may well be the new big in scientific publication - and not a moment too soon.">
