<p>I&rsquo;ve talked with many scientists who like the idea of blogging but insist there just isn&rsquo;t any time to do it. To them I ask: how important is <a href="/articles/2007/05/14/scientific-publication-and-the-seven-deadly-sins">publicizing</a> your work?</p>
<p>The honest ones admit that publicity is an essential element of a successful scientific career.</p>
<p>Scientists everywhere are turning away from old-guard information locating services such as <a href="http://www.cas.org/">Chemical Abstracts Service</a> and toward general-purpose search engines like Google. These ubiquitous new services don&rsquo;t care about your journal&rsquo;s impact factor, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;prestige&rdquo;, or whatever other factor it&rsquo;s being sold to its contributors on. They just care about the relevance of your content.</p>
<p>The process of building a pagerank that leads to your online content landing in the top three results for keyword searches takes time - and <a href="/articles/2007/12/04/signal-to-noise-and-the-chemistry-blog">focus</a>.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re sitting on the fence about starting an online summary of your research or research area (don&rsquo;t call it a blog if you don&rsquo;t want to), how much valuable time have you already wasted by not starting?</p>
