    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>As widely covered in the technical and popular press (<a href="http://money.cnn.com/2008/09/01/technology/google_browser.ap/index.htm?postversion=2008090120">example</a>), later today Google is releasing the first version of its new Web browser, <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/fresh-take-on-browser.html">Chrome</a>. What makes Chrome different from the seemingly endless array of browsers already available?</p>
<p>For now, we&rsquo;ll have to make do with the, umm, <a href="http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/index.html">whitepaper</a>. But if what Google says is to be believed, Chrome is nothing less than a fundamentally new way of looking at the browser&rsquo;s place in the computing ecosystem.</p>
<p>Microsoft looks at the browser as an extension of its proprietary operating system. Firefox, Opera, and Apple look at the browser as a lightweight, fast, standards-compliant, stable application that runs within the host operating system.</p>
<p>Google looks at the browser differently, and Chrome may define a new category of software.</p>
<p>To Google, the browser is an operating system in its own right, with everything the term suggests, ranging from security to isolation of processes to the ability to run demanding applications.</p>
<p>Although Google&rsquo;s not saying so directly, Chrome is a Web-oriented operating system that runs on top of your operating system of choice (or coercion).</p>
