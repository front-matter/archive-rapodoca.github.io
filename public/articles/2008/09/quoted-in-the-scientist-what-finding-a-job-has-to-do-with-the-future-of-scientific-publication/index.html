The article summarizes five tools for prospective job seekers: <a href="http://scilink.com">SciLink</a>; <a href="http://notchup.com">NotchUp</a>; <a href="http://visualcv.com">VisualCV</a>; <a href="http://jibberjobber.com">Jibber Jobber</a>; and <a href="http://meetingwave.com">Meeting Wave</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no coincidence that these are all social networking tools. The problem is that only one, SciLink, even makes an attempt to appeal to scientists specifically.</p>
<p>What will make a successful scientific social networking tool? My guess is that the ones that succeed will, as their primary benefit, make it significantly easier to find collaborators, grants, and jobs. A service established for any other purpose is bound to fail, no matter how much I (and others) wish this weren&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, making it easier to find collaborators, grants, and jobs is exactly the function that scientific publication serves today, when <a href="/articles/2007/05/14/scientific-publication-and-the-seven-deadly-sins">viewed from the perspective of those submitting papers</a>.</p>
<p>Although the traditional scientific publication business model is in <a href="/articles/2008/09/20/dont-let-the-sideshow-distract-you-h-r-6845-and-what-comes-after">deep trouble</a>, the future is very bright for publishers willing to make a clean break with the past.</p>
<p>Anything can happen, but it&rsquo;s likely that the successful scientific publishers of the future will look more like <a href="http://linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a> than the <a href="http://acs.org">American Chemical Society</a>.</p>
<p>Sound impossible? Here&rsquo;s one approach: bring <em>original</em> scientific content together with social networking features. Using recycled content from journals just wouldn&rsquo;t cut it; old-guard publishers and outsiders alike have been there and are doing that (without creating much that can&rsquo;t be found in a different form elsewhere). Original content - perhaps content &ldquo;unpublishable&rdquo; by today&rsquo;s standards because, for example, it&rsquo;s too narrowly focused or describes unsuccessful experiments - would be key.</p>
<p>Whatever the outcome, this kind of system would radically redistribute rewards and outcomes in scientific publication. Which is one reason why you won&rsquo;t find an established publisher willing to touch it with a ten foot spatula.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still a long way from that future (on a technological timescale). I&rsquo;m not aware of a single service that has truly embraced the idea.</p>
<p>If you aspire to build a successful social networking service for scientists, regardless of the angle you take, focus on the boring basics: finding collaborators, jobs, and grants for your users.</p>
