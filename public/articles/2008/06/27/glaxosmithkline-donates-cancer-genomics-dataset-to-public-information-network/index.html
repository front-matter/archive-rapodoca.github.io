    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>In a move likely to up the ante in the emerging <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nrd2131">Open Source Drug Discovery</a> movement, GlaxoSmithKline have <a href="http://us.gsk.com/html/media-news/pressreleases/2008/2008_us_pressrelease_10097.htm">announced</a> the donation of genomic profiling data for over 300 cancer cell lines to the <a href="https://cabig.nci.nih.gov/">National Cancer Institute&rsquo;s cancer Bioinformatics Grid</a> (caBIG).</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://cabig.nci.nih.gov/faqs/index_html">NCI&rsquo;s FAQ</a>, caBIG is &ldquo;an open-source, open-access information network enabling cancer researchers to share tools, data, applications, and technologies according to agreed-upon standards and identified needs.&rdquo; caBIG is comprised of publicly-available datasets and open source software tools designed to interact with them.</p>
<p>This move has potential significance on a number of levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Large pharmaceutical companies haven&rsquo;t generally made a habit out of donating their hard-earned raw intellectual property on this scale. For something this far outside the industry norm, nobody wants to go first; GSK&rsquo;s actions have made the practice a little more respectable.</li>
<li>caBIG is simultaneously a publicly-accessible database, a set of open data specifications, and an open source software platform. In other words, it&rsquo;s striving to become an end-to-end solution to the problem of open collaboration in the biological sciences.</li>
<li>Donating raw data directly into an open repository bypasses the established scientific publication model in which data are communicated only as part of a peer-reviewed publication. Should this new publication model continue to gain popularity, it would fundamentally change the way science is conducted.</li>
</ul>
