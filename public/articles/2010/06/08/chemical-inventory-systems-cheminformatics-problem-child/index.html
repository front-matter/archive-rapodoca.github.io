What Problem?
What problem, you may ask? The problem of finding a sample of a given substance present somewhere in a research lab. Perhaps you need a TLC or NMR standard. Maybe you&rsquo;re interested in starting a synthesis and don&rsquo;t want to waste money buying what you already have. You might even have just run out of your personal supply of a reagent and need to get more quick.">

Having worked in research labs in both industry and academia, it seems that chemical inventory, and particularly the software/hardware to manage it, is one of those universal problems in chemistry.</p>
<h1 id="what-problem">What Problem?</h1>
<p>What problem, you may ask? The problem of finding a sample of a given substance present somewhere in a research lab. Perhaps you need a TLC or NMR standard. Maybe you&rsquo;re interested in starting a synthesis and don&rsquo;t want to waste money buying what you already have. You might even have just run out of your personal supply of a reagent and need to get more quick.</p>
<p>When a member of a lab buys a substance, often the sample is not completely used and so needs to get stored in common storage. Over time, a substantial inventory of chemicals can accumulate. This inventory can be a powerful tool for getting things done faster, cheaper and safer - but only with a good system for finding what you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>One of the new product ideas we&rsquo;re kicking around at <a href="http://metamolecular.com">Metamolecular</a> is a simple, inexpensive, hosted, browser-based chemical inventory management system. So we&rsquo;re looking to see how big this problem might be and how well existing solutions do the job.</p>
<h1 id="where-there-are-many-treatments-there-are-few-cures">Where There Are Many Treatments, There Are Few Cures</h1>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like solutions don&rsquo;t exist; just <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%27chemical+inventory%27&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=">googling &lsquo;chemical inventory&rsquo;</a> turns up a number of companies in the search results (and through paid ads) with products they say work quite well, thank you very much.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just companies offering solutions, either. For example the <a href="https://chemtracker.stanford.edu/">ChemTracker consortium</a>, a non-profit organization, offers a hosted system that apparently is being used by a number of universities in the US.</p>
<p>But having used a couple of these chemical inventory systems in the past, and having listened closely to what was being said about them by others, I&rsquo;m struck by how badly - in general - they seem to do the job. Everything from outright bugs that go unfixed to poor vendor support to frightful usability problems are cited.</p>
<h1 id="practical-cheminformatics">Practical Cheminformatics</h1>
<p>This state of affairs seems surprising given that in any chemical tracking system you&rsquo;ll find a number of great cheminformatics problems to sink your teeth into: substructure search; structure similarity; structure rendering; structure to name conversion; and unique identifiers. (For still more on the subject, see the D-F series on the <a href="http://depth-first.com/articles/2009/08/07/the-restful-chemical-tracking-system-part-1-introduction">design process for a chemical tracking system</a>) Then there&rsquo;s the fact that this kind of software, done well, can make a real difference. Once implemented, a chemical tracking system becomes an integral part of lab chemists&rsquo; workflow.</p>

<p>If you have views on chemical inventory software and would like to share them, we would like to hear from you <!-- raw HTML omitted -->by email<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the web<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. If you work in a lab now, what chemical tracking system do you use? What do you like best about it and what would you change?</p>
