<p>No doubt both sides see their positions as justified given the current economic climate. Publishers are suffering from declining subscriptions and increased costs while libraries are suffering from unprecedented budget shortfalls. In plain English, this means that the business model supporting a big chunk of the modern system of scientific publication is showing <a href="http://depth-first.com/articles/2007/07/27/the-journal-deadpool-failing-business-models-and-sick-markets-in-scientific-publishing">distinct signs of strain</a>.</p>
<p>What will happen between UC and NPG is anybody&rsquo;s guess. One thing is clear: the day may soon arrive when many of your colleagues can no longer access your best research papers.</p>
