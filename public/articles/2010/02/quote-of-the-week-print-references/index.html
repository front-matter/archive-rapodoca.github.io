<p>Of course this is sad. But I don&rsquo;t think all the information literacy training in the world is going to change the trend. We&rsquo;ll get a handful of converts, but we&rsquo;ve lost the masses.</p>
<p>&ndash; A. Ben Wagner, Sciences Librarian, University of Buffalo, via <a href="https://listserv.indiana.edu/cgi-bin/wa-iub.exe?A2=ind1002&amp;L=CHMINF-L&amp;P=63279">CHMINF-L</a></p>

<p>I wonder - what factors exactly are driving this change? I&rsquo;m not talking about widely discussed topics such as convenience or the generation gap, but less widely-discussed factors such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(web_application_hybrid)">mashability</a> and cheap access to tools enabling personal and small group use of ever larger quantities of data. If your organization is in the business of selling access to scientific information, its very survival could depend on a deep understanding of the answer to this question.</p>
