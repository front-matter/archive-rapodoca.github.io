That&rsquo;s the question many have been asking for some time about Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) and its relationship to the American Chemical Society (ACS).</p>
<h1 id="too-big-to-be-non-profit">Too Big to Be Non-Profit?</h1>
<p>I was again reminded of this question after having finally been <a href="http://depth-first.com/articles/2010/06/29/linkedin-forums-how-do-i-despise-thee-let-me-count-the-ways">granted access to the ACS LinkedIn Group</a>. In a recent thread discussing the <a href="http://portal.acs.org:80/preview/fileFetch/C/CNBP_025065/pdf/CNBP_025065.pdf">the most recent (and possibly final) loss by the ACS in its protracted legal battle against LeadScope</a>, one participant <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?mostPopular=&amp;gid=51209">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think the time has come&ndash;in fact, it came a while ago&ndash;to hive off CAS as a for-profit entity. I don&rsquo;t see any other way to justify ACS continuing as a non-profit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What makes this comment remarkable is not so much the sentiment, which seems to be widely-held outside the ACS, but rather the professional background of the person who made it, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/mary-thomson/5/401/252">Mary Thomson</a>. According to her profile, Ms. Thomson served as Associate Editor of Chemical Abstracts Service from 1986 through 1992. She probably knows, better than most in this debate, what she&rsquo;s talking about.</p>
<h1 id="by-the-numbers">By the Numbers</h1>
<p>One question that should arise whenever this issue comes up is: how much money does the ACS actually make from CAS?</p>
<p>In past years, the ACS has pursued greater transparency in its operations, starting with easy public access to its financial statements. For example, you can view the <a href="http://portal.acs.org:80/portal/PublicWebSite/about/aboutacs/financial/CNBP_024242">ACS 2009 Audited Financial Statement here</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, revenues are not traceable back to CAS, as far as I can tell. The best we can do is look at all revenues deriving from &ldquo;Electronic Services&rdquo;, which for 2009 totaled just under $376 Million, or 80% of ACS revenues. In contrast, &ldquo;Dues&rdquo; revenues totaled $12 Million and &ldquo;Registration Fees and Booth Sales&rdquo; (presumably from meetings) just under $10 Million.</p>
<p>Any way you slice it, &ldquo;Electronic Services&rdquo; generate serious money and no doubt contribute the lion&rsquo;s share to the ACS annual operating budget.</p>
<p>What portion of ACS&rsquo; $376 Million in revenues from Electronic Services comes from CAS? That&rsquo;s tough to say. The report does have a separate category for &ldquo;Printed Services&rdquo;, which totaled $24 Million in 2009. Whether these printed services include subscription fees to online journals is anybody&rsquo;s guess.</p>
<p>As reported by ACS, expenses related to &ldquo;Information Services&rdquo; totaled $350 Million in 2009. Again, it&rsquo;s not clear how much of this figure derives from CAS directly or even what this category entails.</p>
<h1 id="bottom-line">Bottom Line</h1>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear that electronic services generate nearly all of the money that ACS takes in every year, and that this is a sizable figure in absolute terms. To what extent should these revenue centers be allowed to continue operation within the protections afforded to a non-profit organization in the United States?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a question for all of us, as ACS members, to decide.</p>
