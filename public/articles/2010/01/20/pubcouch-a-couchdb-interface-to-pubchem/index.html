An open source project called PubCouch has been set up on GitHub. PubCouch will be written in native CouchDB JavaScript (with an import utility written in a language TBA). I have no idea how this will turn out and no preconceptions about what it needs to be. If you like what you see, I encourage you to create a fork and start hacking.">

I&rsquo;ve recently become interested in <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a> and other so-called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL">NoSQL</a> databases as an alternative to traditional approaches.</p>
<p>This article, the first in a series, explores how CouchDB can be applied to real-world cheminformatics problems using <a href="/articles/2006/09/29/hacking-pubchem-direct-access-with-ftp">the PubChem dataset</a>.</p>

<p>An open source project called <a href="http://github.com/metamolecular/pubcouch">PubCouch</a> has been set up on GitHub. PubCouch will be written in native CouchDB JavaScript (with an import utility written in a language TBA). I have no idea how this will turn out and no preconceptions about what it needs to be.

<h1 id="a-solution-in-search-of-a-problem">A Solution in Search of a Problem</h1>
<p>For my money, the best way to learn a new technology is to apply it to a simple, but real problem that seems to be a good match. Until now, <a href="/articles/2009/04/22/couchdb-for-chemistry">that problem was lacking</a>. Thanks to one of my clients, who would like some information that may be extractable from PubChem, I may have just the excuse (er&hellip; problem) I needed.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever <a href="/articles/2006/09/29/hacking-pubchem-direct-access-with-ftp">used the PubChem dataset</a>, you&rsquo;ve probably noticed it&rsquo;s not the easiest thing to work with. For one thing - it&rsquo;s BIG. For another, it&rsquo;s not relational; instead, the PubChem dataset consists of a collection of individual documents assembled into files.</p>
<p>Awhile back, I wrote about one approach to working with PubChem in which <a href="/articles/2008/05/26/simple-cas-number-lookup-and-more-with-chempedia">each Structure and Substance was broken down into tables with relationships</a>. In this, case, the document-oriented nature of the PubChem dataset was converted into a relational system that could be easily used from an RDBMS.</p>
<p>But document-oriented databases like CouchDB offer an intriguing alternative. Instead of overlaying a preconceived database schema on the PubChem dataset, we can dynamically generate these relationships on a case-by-case basis using <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Introduction_to_CouchDB_views">MapReduce</a>.</p>

<h1 id="a-general-plan">A General Plan</h1>
<p>PubCouch will start off with some basic tools for converting raw PubChem FTP downloads into CouchDB documents. It&rsquo;ll then move on to creating some simple MapReduce functions to answer basic questions. If the project is still alive at this point, it may then be dedicated to creating a range of MapReduce functions for performing a variety of sophisticated queries against the entire PubChem dataset, possibly taking advantage of CouchDB&rsquo;s <a href="http://books.couchdb.org/relax/reference/replication">highly-touted replication capabilities</a>.</p>
