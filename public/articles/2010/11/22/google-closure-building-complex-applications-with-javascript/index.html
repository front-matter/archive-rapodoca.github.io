<p>Today, JavaScript is being used to create software of increasing complexity and scale. This article, the first in a series, introduces <a href="http://code.google.com/closure/">Google Closure</a>, an especially effective tool for building client-side JavaScript applications that scale.</p>
<p>This will be no theoretical discussion. At the beginning of this year <a href="http://metamolecular.com">my company</a> committed itself to re-writing its flagship product <a href="http://chemwriter.com">ChemWriter</a>, a chemical structure drawing tool, in JavaScript using Closure. We&rsquo;ve been working with it since - a lot. In this series, I&rsquo;d like to share some of our experiences.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re considering writing (or re-writing) an interactive client, the combination of JavaScript and browsers has a lot to offer as a platform - even if you&rsquo;re targeting mobile uses. But unless your resources are unlimited, you&rsquo;re going to need a JavaScript framework to do the grunt work for you. Browsers are too inconsistent and lack higher-level interfaces to unlock their full functionality, and JavaScript the language has too many rough edges. A JavaScript framework solves these problems for you.</p>
<p>We considered many options for a JavaScript framework before starting. Closure was the one that best suited our needs, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proven cross-browser capabilities, particularly event handling, dom manipulation, and graphics.</li>
<li>Clear object-oriented structure.</li>
<li>Well-written documentation.</li>
<li>Cross-browser support for vector graphics, including IE7/8.</li>
<li>Support for complex manipulation of geometrical shapes, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation">affine transformations</a>.</li>
<li>Maintained by a dedicated team with significant resources and vested interest in success.</li>
<li>Source code minification and obfuscation with the option to run code in its original form at any time.</li>
<li>Emphasis on high performance.</li>
<li>Open sourced under an <a href="/articles/2006/12/29/dispelling-open-source-confusion-an-introduction-to-licenses/">academic-style license</a>.</li>
<li>Capable of working with BDD-style testing frameworks such as <a href="/articles/2009/11/23/javascript-survival-screw-unit/">Screw.Unit</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your needs may differ, but if they overlap with ours, you might want to consider Closure.</p>
<h1 id="stop-right-now-and-get-this-book">Stop Right Now and Get This Book</h1>
<p>One of our requirements, well-written documentation, was only partially met by Closure at the time we started using it. That situation has since changed for the better. <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/0636920001416">Closure: The Definitive Guide</a> is essential reading for anyone interested in using Google Closure.</p>
<p>In case you&rsquo;re new to JavaScript, I can also highly recommend <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596517748">JavaScript: The Good Parts</a>.</p>
<p>These two books should be enough background to start any project using Closure.</p>
<h1 id="where-to">Where To?</h1>
<p>Although a lot of good Closure documentation exists, we&rsquo;ve found a few situations in which a concise discussion of a specific Closure problem and a workable solution would have come in handy. The articles to follow will reveal solutions to some problems in using Closure effectively.</p>
