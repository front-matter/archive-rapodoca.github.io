<p>I recently gave a presentation about <a href="http://chempedia.com">Chempedia</a> and <a href="http://lab.chempedia.com">Chempedia Lab</a> at the <a href="http://portal.acs.org:80/portal/acs/corg/content?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=PP_TRANSITIONMAIN&amp;node_id=2060&amp;use_sec=false&amp;sec_url_var=region1&amp;__uuid=009dddf8-3420-4e6d-812d-186e0c3f8343">Spring 2010 ACS</a> in San Francisco.</p>
<p>The symposium that this talk was part of (&ldquo;The Future of Scholarly Communication&rdquo;) was thought-provoking and at times visibly charged. I was struck most by the number of pay-per-view and subscription-based information services who seemed to feel obliged to explain the costs they were passing on to customers. Peer-review and quality assurance in scientific communication were also recurring themes that are inextricably linked to the problem of paying for this system we all use.</p>
<p>There was broad agreement about the importance of quality and accessibility to chemical information, and quite a few ideas about how best to achieve these goals.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing like giving a live demo to expose usability issues. During the Chempedia registry demo, I was (apparently) unable to log in through OpenID. It turns out that what I expected to see was this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/20100325/expected.png" alt="Expected" title="Expected"></p>
<p>but what I saw was this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/20100325/actual.png" alt="Actual" title="Actual"></p>
<p>Clicking on the lock icon in the lower-left gets you to the view in the top image, and sets a cookie to remember this view next time you visit the page. All of my practice demos had been with this cookie set, so when I didn&rsquo;t see the text field on the house laptop, it looked like there was something wrong with the OpenID component.</p>
<p>Long story short, there was no OpenID problem. But it&rsquo;s not difficult to see how some users might not know what to do on this screen because there&rsquo;s nothing that looks like a traditional login area.</p>
<p>During my talk, an audience member asked a question about whether <a href="http://chempedia.com">Chempedia</a> could be used to associate URLs with substances (btw, if anyone knows how I can get in touch with this person, please drop me a line). My response was that this subject would be covered later in the talk (Slide 38), but time constraints didn&rsquo;t permit me to go into detail.</p>
<p>The answer is that Chempedia doesn&rsquo;t yet support URL-substance associations, but this capability is central to Chempedia&rsquo;s mission.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll explain in detail what I mean in an upcoming post.</p>
