    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>My last article on <a href="/articles/2010/03/30/why-most-chemists-still-dont-use-rss-and-why-you-should-care">why chemists don&rsquo;t use rss</a> generated a lot of discussion, both in comments and via email, so I started thinking about a solution.</p>
<p>One of the problems I faced in my informal survey of chemists was that there was no single Web resource I could point to that said &ldquo;Here are the feeds for the journals you read, and here&rsquo;s some simple information on how to use them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Web makes solving problems like this dead simple - just do it.</p>
<p>So here it is: <a href="http://metamolecular.com/resources/rss-and-atom-feeds-for-chemistry-journals">everything you ever needed to know about using chemistry journal RSS and Atom feeds to stay current with the literature</a>.</p>
<p>I have no idea whether this will be helpful or not, but if you&rsquo;re in the position of trying to tell your fellow chemist about what they&rsquo;re missing - you might try showing them this link.</p>
