    <title>Chempedia Lab: Slides from Fall 2010 ACS Meeting in Boston | Depth-First</title>

The slide deck above is the one I presented at the Fall ACS in Boston discussing Chempedia Lab. Although attendance at the symposium was on the light side, based on the Q&amp;A at the end and discussions afterward I learned that: (1) the idea of Chempedia Lab seems to resonate; and (2) Chempedia Lab still isn&rsquo;t widely-known as a resource for answering experimental chemistry questions.
The talks at this symposium spanned a wide range of uses of the Web and social media in chemistry - from education to research. Two struck me in particular. One was by Phil Janowics from Cal State Fullerton who talked about building a worldwide virtual chemistry classroom. The other was from Aaron Finke (Carbon Based Curiosities) who talked about social and scientific issues of blogging in chemistry.">

<p>The slide deck above is the one I presented at the Fall ACS in Boston discussing <a href="http://lab.chempedia.com">Chempedia Lab</a>. Although attendance at the symposium was on the light side, based on the Q&amp;A at the end and discussions afterward I learned that: (1) the idea of Chempedia Lab seems to resonate; and (2) Chempedia Lab still isn&rsquo;t widely-known as a resource for answering experimental chemistry questions.</p>
<p>The talks at this symposium spanned a wide range of uses of the Web and social media in chemistry - from education to research. Two struck me in particular. One was by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/philjanowicz">Phil Janowics</a> from Cal State Fullerton who talked about building a worldwide virtual chemistry classroom. The other was from <a href="http://sulfur.scs.uiuc.edu/members/finke.html">Aaron Finke</a> (<a href="http://www.coronene.com/blog/">Carbon Based Curiosities</a>) who talked about <a href="http://www.coronene.com/blog/?p=1311">social and scientific issues of blogging in chemistry</a>.</p>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;d like to see more of in future symposia on this topic is talks discussing Web technologies that can be applied to the communication of chemical information. I think there&rsquo;s an unfortunate tendency by those experimenting with the Web and social media in chemistry to use tools that may less than ideally suited to the job. Likewise, it&rsquo;s important for developers to see new opportunities emerging from non-technical users of the Web. Technology-focused talks at these kinds of symposia might help bridge the gap.</p>
