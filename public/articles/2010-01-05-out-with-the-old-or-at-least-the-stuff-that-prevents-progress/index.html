It used what was at the time an up-and-coming blogging engine called <a href="http://wiki.github.com/fdv/typo/">Typo</a>. I chose Typo because it did most of what I needed and was written in <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a>, a Web development framework I wanted to learn more about.</p>
<h1 id="bitrot">Bitrot</h1>
<p>I had no idea that 597 articles later, I&rsquo;d still be using essentially the same software. At some point very early on I was unable to upgrade Typo and that was that - Depth-First&rsquo;s blogging engine became frozen.</p>
<p>Although Typo continued to work, a combination of factors convinced me this was a dead-end. The frequent reboots to treat a persistent memory leak, and the need for a beefy server to cope. The double-posted comments due to a buggy AJAX implementation. The syntax highlighting system that didn&rsquo;t do Java or JavaScript, and which choked on larger code samples. The inability to interface with conversations happening elsewhere online. And most recently, a barrage of <a href="http://www.jasonmorrison.net/content/2008/quick-tip-keeping-comment-compliment-spam-off-your-blog/">compliment spam</a> (there&rsquo;s a special place in hell for these people).</p>
<h1 id="out-with-the-old">Out With The Old</h1>
<p>I had had enough. I looked at alternatives, and didn&rsquo;t find any that suited my needs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Written in Ruby on Rails.</strong> I&rsquo;m not a fan of waiting for a patch to be written or a plugin to be developed. If something needs to be fixed or added, I want to know I can get right in and do it. For example, I&rsquo;m playing with ideas for using Depth-First&rsquo;s nearly 1,000 tags more effectively, and there&rsquo;s nothing like doing that iteratively with a live system.</li>
<li><strong>Inline Admin Interface.</strong> Separating administration from content is not a good idea. Not only do you end up with duplicated code, but it forces the administrator to jump back and forth between contexts to fix things (&rsquo;now, what was the title of that article I needed to edit&hellip;&rsquo;).</li>
<li><strong>Designed around <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a> (authentication) and <a href="http://disqus.com">Disqus</a> (comments).</strong> The Web is getting more organized, with services starting to take the place of monolithic systems. OpenID and Disqus are two names to watch in this area.</li>
<li><strong>Deployable with Heroku&rsquo;s Free Plan</strong> I&rsquo;ve <a href="/tags/heroku">written about Heroku before</a> and think it&rsquo;s a great service. The ideal blogging system should work out of the box with <a href="http://heroku.com/pricing#blossom-1">Heroku&rsquo;s free hosting plan</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Pluggable</strong> To customize most Rails applications means getting way too intimate with the underlying models, views, and controllers. I needed an application that could be selectively &lsquo;overridden&rsquo;. <a href="http://github.com/markbates/warp_drive">Warp Drive</a> was just what I was looking for, but no blogging engine supported it out of the box.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="hubbub">Hubbub</h1>
<p>Not finding any blogging system that fit the bill, I decided to write my own. After all, how hard could it be ;-) ? The result is <a href="http://github.com/rapodaca/hubbub">Hubbub</a>, the pluggable Rails blogging engine. I&rsquo;ll have more to say on Hubbub and what &lsquo;pluggable&rsquo; means in future articles.</p>
<p>There are still some rough edges to be sure. For example, the layout and JavaScript commenting system are broken (to different degrees) in IE 6 and IE 7. And I&rsquo;m still working on adding the static content pages (those links at the very top of this page). If you find anything else that doesn&rsquo;t work as expected, please <!-- raw HTML omitted -->drop me a line<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<h1 id="on-backward-compatibility">On Backward-Compatibility</h1>
<p>One of the biggest challenges on this project was maintaining backward-compatibility. For example, it was essential that all articles continue to be accessed from their existing URLs (to maintain the <a href="/articles/2007/08/09/ten-things-that-surprised-me-about-blogging">integrity of the archive</a>). Likewise, comments needed to be moved and reformatted, a custom-job that took much more time than expected. I may write about the tools I used to convert Depth-First&rsquo;s comments to Disqus at some point.</p>
<p>Although there are rough edges around the imported comments, all article links should work as before. Please let me know if you find otherwise.</p>
<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
<p>In the case of Depth-First, &lsquo;broken&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t happen all at once, but developed over time. Solving the problem resulted in Hubbub, a pluggable blogging engine that may actually have some application to cheminformatics. But more about that later.</p>
