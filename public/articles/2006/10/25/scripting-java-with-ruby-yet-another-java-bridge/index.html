<p>Previous articles, starting with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this one<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, have discussed <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ruby Java Bridge<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (RJB) as a Java-Ruby integration tool. Two additional articles discussed RJB in the context of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mapping Java packages onto Ruby modules<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Java-Ruby integration on Windows<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. RJB currently provides the mechanism whereby the full <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Chemistry Development Kit<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (CDK) API can be used in Ruby with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ruby CDK<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Another option for Java-Ruby integration is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->JRuby<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a Java implementation of the Ruby interpreter. JRuby offers tight integration with the Java Virtual Machine, which will be ideal in many situations. In other situations, it will not be the best choice. For example, one of the advantages of RJB over JRuby is that the standard C-Ruby implementation can be used. This in turn offers, for example, full <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rails<!-- raw HTML omitted --> functionality and access to C extensions. A disadvantage of RJB is that, being written in C, it requires a working build toolchain for installation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen <!-- raw HTML omitted -->one report<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of a Macintosh installation of RJB that failed. Without a Mac of my own, I can&rsquo;t confirm if this is indeed a problem. But this report also pointed me to a third approach to Ruby-Java integration, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yet Another Java Bridge<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (YAJB). YAJB is different from both JRuby and RJB in that it extends the C implementation of Ruby with a Java bridge written in pure Java. In theory, it should run on any platform that both Ruby and Java run on.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->YAJB-0.8.1<!-- raw HTML omitted --> installed on my system without a hitch. From the root directory of the distribution:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Using YAJB was straightforward. A Java <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Vector<!-- raw HTML omitted --> instance could be instantiated and manipulated using familiar syntax:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span style="display:flex;"><span>require <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;yajb/jbridge&#39;</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Good integration tools can make the difference between actually using new technologies and simply observing them. Java developers interested in using Ruby now have at least three good options to choose from: JRuby; RJB; and YAJB.</p>
