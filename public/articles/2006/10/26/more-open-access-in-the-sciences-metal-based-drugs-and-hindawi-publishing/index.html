    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>A <!-- raw HTML omitted -->recent article<!-- raw HTML omitted --> discussed chemistry-related journals in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Directory of Open Access Journals<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (DOAJ). In going through some of my bookmarks, I stumbled on an Open Access journal that DOAJ doesn&rsquo;t have: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Metal-Based Drugs<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the last available issue of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Metal-Based Drugs<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is from 2002. It&rsquo;s not clear if this journal is defunct or not. The journal&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Author Guidelines link<!-- raw HTML omitted --> points to the publisher&rsquo;s general manuscript submission system. There&rsquo;s no mention of publication terminating, so the status of this journal is still a bit of a mystery.</p>
<p>But something interesting appears on the right-hand side of the journal&rsquo;s homepage. It&rsquo;s a sidebar listing news from the publisher, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hindawi Publishing<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. One of the items reads simply: &ldquo;Retrodigitization of back volumes of Metal-Based Drugs is completed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hindawi Publishing runs <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a few dozen Open Access scientific journals<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in addition to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Metal-Based Drugs<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Their Open Access work has been covered many times in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Peter Suber&rsquo;s Open Access News<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. From a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->report on Hindawi<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Electronic Publishing Service&rsquo;s Majied Robinson:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; In an interview with EPS, Hindawi&rsquo;s Senior Publishing Developer Paul Peters said that the company was looking to acquire more titles to digitise and make freely available .. as well as the establishment of new journals in new fields.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At least one publisher is actively buying the rights to existing journals for the purpose of running them with an Open Access model. Are there any other companies doing the same? What new business models might emerge from these activities to recover their costs - or even turn a profit?</p>
