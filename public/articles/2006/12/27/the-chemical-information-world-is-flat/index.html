<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ci60013a001">Eugene Garfield</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thirty years may have passed, but the situation described by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Garfield<!-- raw HTML omitted --> rings eerily familiar today. What could not have been anticipated is the degree to which the playing field for information producers is being flattened. Today&rsquo;s scientist-reviewer employs many of the same tools, accesses the same distribution channels, and eventually will compete for the same readers as established journals, databases, and other services.</p>
<p>For example, consider the sharp increase in the number of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->chemistry-related blogs<!-- raw HTML omitted --> within the last year. Although the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->underlying technologies<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are woefully ill-suited to the job, a groundswell of both writers and readers for this type of scientific communication has been exposed.</p>
<p>How far out can this trend be extrapolated? Garfield has argued that &ldquo;in the future, it would be more and more difficult to distinguish (ordinary) laboratory scientists from information specialists.&rdquo; Looking back at the last thirty years, there is ample evidence to support this claim for information consumers and producers alike. How well are you and your organization positioned to thrive in the flat chemical information world that lies ahead?</p>
