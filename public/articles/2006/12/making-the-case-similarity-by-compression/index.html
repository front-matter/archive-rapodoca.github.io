<p>Yet another appearance of Open Source software in the literature comes by way of a paper from Melville, Riley, and Hirst. This work takes advantage of the alphabet-like nature of SMILES strings and widely-available compression algorithms to perform molecular similarity analyses. Not only does this work use the Open Source <!-- raw HTML omitted -->JOELib<!-- raw HTML omitted --> library but the authors have made the Ruby scripts that perform the similarity analysis <!-- raw HTML omitted -->freely available<!-- raw HTML omitted --> under the same terms as Ruby (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ruby&rsquo;s license<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->GPL<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>
