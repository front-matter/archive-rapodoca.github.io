<p>If Mr Gushee was right, then why didn&rsquo;t the system collapse under its own weight in the nearly 40 years since he wrote these words? Is it possible that calls for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Open Access<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in scientific publishing are missing something fundamental in the culture of science? Why has the nature of scientific publishing changed so little in almost 300 years of continuous operation? Maybe revolutionary advances in information technology kept the system viable. But if that&rsquo;s true, why couldn&rsquo;t the trend continue?</p>
