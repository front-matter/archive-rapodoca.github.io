<p>Apparently, advances in chemical line notations have a history of occurring in clusters. Perhaps the development of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->InChI<!-- raw HTML omitted --> will spawn a renaissance in the development and use of line notations. Is there room (or need) for multiple line notation languages, each filling a particular niche, or can a universal line notation ever be developed? Will currently popular line notations such as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SMILES<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and InChI seem as cumbersome in 30 years as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wiswesser Line Notation<!-- raw HTML omitted --> does today?</p>
