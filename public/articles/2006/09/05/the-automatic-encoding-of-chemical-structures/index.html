<p>Feldman and his group at Walter Reed faced a similar problem in the early 1960&rsquo;s. American Cyanamide had been using a modified typewriter to prepare attractive 2-D chemical structures, purely for human consumption. Feldman&rsquo;s idea was to modify the typewriter design still further such that a computer-usable molecular code would be recorded as a byproduct of preparing the structure diagram. The typist could remain blissfully unaware of the mechanical magic beneath, and get on with his or her job. The idea was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->later adapted<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Shell to produce a more cost-effective device.</p>
<p>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->structure editor<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has long since replaced the chemical typewriter. But the same forces are at work with today&rsquo;s new molecular encoding methods, especially <!-- raw HTML omitted -->InChI<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. To what extent are scientists themselves being given the tools to leverage these new technologies, without having to become aware of them? What will these new tools look like and how will they differ from what came before?</p>
