    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Recently, I wrote a tutorial on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->embedding 2-D molecular renderings<!-- raw HTML omitted --> into webpages as Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). This tutorial also contained a small experiment on the current chemical informatics capabilities of the Web.</p>
<p>Here is a scenario from the near future: Joe is writing a review on Cephalosporin C that he wants to publish the modern way - directly to the Web. An entirely new concept in scientific publishing has started to take hold. Rather than submitting scientific articles to publishers, who then <!-- raw HTML omitted -->make hamburger<!-- raw HTML omitted --> out of them and strip authors of their rights to reproduce their own work, a new system in which journals simply aggregate <!-- raw HTML omitted -->content already on the Web<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is gaining momentum. Some journals specialize in only including the very best scientific Web content available, and so enjoy a prestige factor. It&rsquo;s still a peer review system, but with inversion of control. The trick for scientists is getting their work indexed, and so noticed, in the first place.</p>
<p>Joe just downloaded a new 2-D structure editor, FooChemPaint, that he heard can make the structure drawings in his review structure-searchable. Every chemist he knows is talking about a new free search engine called Haystac (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hayst<!-- raw HTML omitted -->ac <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A<!-- raw HTML omitted -->in&rsquo;t <!-- raw HTML omitted -->C<!-- raw HTML omitted -->hmoogle) that lets them substructure-search the web. For some reason, you need to create your structures using FooChemPaint if you want your own documents to be included in the search results.</p>
<p>After Joe finishes drawing Cephalosporin C with FooChemPaint, he chooses the File-&gt;Save As&hellip; menu item. Instead of saving as a JPG or PNG like he&rsquo;s done with other software, he saves the image as SVG. He then embeds the SVG into his review using a procedure similar to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->one I outlined previously<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>From Joe&rsquo;s perspective, he hasn&rsquo;t done anything very new. But unknown to Joe, FooChemPaint has automatically inserted the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->InChI identifier<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of Cephalosporin C as metadata into his SVG document. This enables <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ordinary search engines<!-- raw HTML omitted --> such as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to associate the InChI with his SVG. The best part is that the entire process is essentially <!-- raw HTML omitted -->invisible<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to Joe.</p>
<p>Haystac is a web application that presents users with an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->online structure editor<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for preparing molecular queries. When a structure query is submitted, Haystac searches its molecular database for matches. This database, in turn, was built by a web spider specifically designed to look for InChI identifiers, maybe with the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->help of Google&rsquo;s Web API<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. One of Haystac&rsquo;s records for the structure of Cephalosporin C points to Joe&rsquo;s review article.</p>
<p>Science fiction? Maybe. This is where the experiment comes in. Before I submitted the article on SVG, I manually annotated the SVG of Alprazolam with the corresponding InChI. The XML source can be viewed in Firefox by right-clicking on the SVG image and choosing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This Frame-&gt;View Frame Source<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, or alternatively <a href="/images/posts/20060907/alprazolam.svg">here</a>. Below is a fragment of the XML:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Today I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->searched<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for the title of my article in Google and found it. I then searched for the InChI in the SVG metadata and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->did not find it<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Currently, a search of this InChI shows only one hit from the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->DrugBank<!-- raw HTML omitted --> database.</p>
<p>The experiment failed in its stated goal of getting the InChI of Alprazolam indexed by Google via the metadata in its SVG rendering. Was it the formatting of my RDF tags? Is metadata just indexed more slowly than other content? Does Google just ignore metadata to avoid <!-- raw HTML omitted -->keyword stuffing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Search Engine Optimization tricksters? Are embedded SVG documents ignored by Google altogether? Whatever the reason, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->technical<!-- raw HTML omitted --> barriers to a system like this working today are very low and dropping rapidly.</p>
