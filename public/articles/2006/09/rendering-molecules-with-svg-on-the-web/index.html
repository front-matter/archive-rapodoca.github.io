Unlike raster image formats such as PNG, JPEG, and GIF, SVG images can be scaled to any resolution without pixelation.

<p>In this first article of a series on SVG and chemical informatics, I&rsquo;ll start by showing some embedded SVG images of molecules (also see <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this demo<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). Later articles will discuss technical details such as writing, reading, animating, scripting, editing, annotating, and distributing 2-D structures encoded as SVG.</p>
<h1 id="now-the-bad-news">Now, the Bad News</h1>
<p>SVG is a work in progress. Browser support and performance can vary widely. If you are using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Firefox<!-- raw HTML omitted --> version 1.5 or better, you should be able to see all of the images in this article without doing anything.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Internet Explorer users, Microsoft&rsquo;s browser lacks built-in SVG support. Still worse, IE 7 appears ready to continue this perplexing tradition. Fortunately, Adobe offers an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SVG plugin for IE<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Although this page was tested in both IE 6 (with Adobe&rsquo;s plugin) and Firefox 1.5 (both Windows and Linux), your particular configuration may vary. Please feel free to post your experiences.</p>
<h1 id="some-simple-svg-structures">Some Simple SVG Structures</h1>
<p>The examples below illustrate how SVG images of molecules can be embedded in an HTML document. These images just scratch the surface of what is possible. If you don&rsquo;t see 2-D structures, your browser may lack SVG support.</p>
