    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>By the morning of March 24, the evidence pointed to a <a href="/articles/2023/05/27/the-scary-stuff/">lemon-sized, cancerous tumor</a> within my brain&rsquo;s right <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parietal_lobe">parietal lobe</a>. Its presence explained <a href="/articles/2023/05/18/everyone-has-a-plan/">my symptoms</a> in the weeks prior to <a href="/articles/2023/05/20/er/">visiting the ER</a>. At the moment I was lying in a bed waiting to be admitted to the hospital. Clearly there was no chance of going home anytime soon.</p>
<p>While waiting, still more neurological tests were performed. Squeeze both fingers. Stick out your tongue. Raise both eyebrows. Smile wide. Follow the light with your eyes. That kind of thing. I seemed to pass them all except for acting like I was holding out a pizza with my eyes closed. I bombed that one over and over.</p>
<p>By this point, I was sufficiently mobile to use the bathroom without help. I&rsquo;d entered the ER able to walk, albeit with some difficulty. Had I realized what a high-water mark of athletic fitness that would end up being, I might have paid more attention.</p>
<p>Dr. Hospitalist approached my bedside. A brain surgery was going to take place soon.</p>
<p><em>Uh, what?</em></p>
<p>Within the course of just one day I&rsquo;d gone from having strange neurological symptoms to a doctor telling me that an interdisciplinary team was being assembled to cut open my skull and pull out a brain tumor. The technical terms were &ldquo;craniotomy&rdquo; and &ldquo;resection.&rdquo; A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craniotomy"><em>craniotomy</em></a> (be warned) is a surgical procedure in which a section of skull is removed to afford access to the brain during a subsequent procedure. The skull section so removed is preserved, and then replaced. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_tumor"><em>resection</em></a> is a surgical procedure to remove a brain tumor.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have a lot more to say about the technical details later. For now, suffice it to say that I felt the same way about the good doctor&rsquo;s news that I did about his Keppra idea.</p>
<p>This was all happening way to fast. I needed time to at least consider what my options were.</p>
<p>I asked, &ldquo;What happens if I just skip the surgery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer was quick and confident, &ldquo;There is no &rsquo;no surgery&rsquo;. You&rsquo;ll be dead in three months.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t know it at the time, but Dr. Hospitalist was basing this prediction on a rather large body of hard evidence. Whatever kind of cancer I now had, it was on a mission to kill me and it was a badass.</p>
<p>Two options were presented: (1) a biopsy alone; or (2) combined surgery and biopsy. Dr. Hospitalist recommended (2), noting the outcome was likely to be be much better than (1). Whatever downsides might result were not presented in any detail. I chose the surgery/biopsy, but in my heart wanted to get the hell out of there and never go back.</p>
<p>Dr. Hospitalist left the room, leaving me to sort through what he had said.</p>
<p>Late that afternoon, the doctor who had shown the brain MRI images the previous evening stopped by. Dr. Surgery Resident, as I&rsquo;ll refer to him here, told me that my brain surgery was scheduled for March 28, four days from that point.</p>
<p>Dr. Surgery Resident also sketched out a possible path forward. The surgery would last about three hours. I&rsquo;d be admitted to the hospital and so all further tests/treatments could be done by them. At best the symptoms would stop progressing post-operation. At worst, there would be a 6-12 month recovery.</p>
<p>Dr. Surgery Resident also explained the significance of the tumor&rsquo;s location: my right parietal lobe. I&rsquo;ll have much more to say about this later. For now suffice it to say that this part of the brain is involved in sensory integration, attention, and pattern recognition.</p>
