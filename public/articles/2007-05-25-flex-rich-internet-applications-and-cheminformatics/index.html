<p>Building <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Internet_application">Rich Internet Applications</a> (RIAs) is no easy task. The technologies are all there, but twelve years after the release of Netscape Navigator, Web developers are still hacking around browser idiosyncrasies.</p>
<p>From JavaScript to HTML, to CSS, browser quirks are still a fact of life. Browsers tend to disagree the most on the more advanced features, but examples of less advanced features requiring cross-browser work-arounds continue to suck up large amounts of developer time.</p>
<p>Even Java applets get in on the act. The interface between applets and the browser is the most poorly-defined aspect of the technology. Particularly with respect to <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4984794">keyboard focus</a>, <a href="http://forum.java.sun.com/thread.jspa?threadID=348710&amp;messageID=2031874">persisting applet state</a>, and even <a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/J2SE/Desktop/ieappletguide/">initial activation</a>, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;write once, test everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Recently, I saw a presentation by <a href="http://www.jamesward.org/wordpress/">James Ward</a> on a technology called <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/">Flex</a> that&rsquo;s aimed squarely at solving the Rich Internet Application problem.</p>
<p>Flex is a platform for building software that runs on the Flash multimedia player. If you&rsquo;ve developed Java applets, you already know a lot about how Flex works. Here are some of the key points James brought up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flex applications are written in ECMAScript (aka JavaScript) and run on the Flash 9 runtime. The language offers, among other features, variable typing. This stands in contrast to the non-typed form of JavaScript typically used in browsers.</li>
<li>Sometime in 2007, Flex will be open sourced. The <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/downloads/">developer kit</a> is currently a free download.</li>
<li>A desktop-native runtime for Flex called <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/apollo/">Apollo</a> is nearing release.</li>
<li>A variety of eye-popping examples of Flex in action are available. My favorites so far: <a href="http://demo.quietlyscheming.com/book/Anatomy.html">FlexBook</a> and <a href="http://picnik.com">Picnik</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/posts/20070525/flashbook.png" alt="Flash Book" title="Flash Book"></p>
<p>Adobe is clearly trying to position Flash/Flex as the successor to Java applets. By ensuring that Flash works the same way in all browsers, has a rich API for interacting with the browser, and is available on all platforms, they just might succeed.</p>
<p>Adobe claims that Flash is the most widely-installed multimedia browser plug-in. According to a <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/player_census/flashplayer/">recent study</a>, nearly 99% of browsers have some version of Flash installed (congratulations to <a href="http://cheminfo.informatics.indiana.edu/~rguha/">Rajarshi Guha</a> for almost immediately getting the <a href="http://depth-first.com/articles/2007/05/23/name-that-graph">Name that Graph</a>). Adoption of Flash 9, the latest version and the one required to run Flex applications, <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/player_census/flashplayer/version_penetration.html">is significantly lower</a>. My guess is that these numbers will rise quickly given the availability of Flash 9 for Linux and the mere 1.5 MB download footprint.</p>
<p>If Flex has anything going against it, it&rsquo;s probably the small footprint of the Flash player. One of the first things you&rsquo;ll notice about many feature-rich Flex applications is how long they take to download relative to comparable Java applets. What the Flash runtime lacks, your application may well have to supply on deployment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m unaware of a single use of Flex/Flash in cheminformatics. This is really quite surprising given the highly visual nature of cheminformatics and the refined graphics capabilities of the Flash player. Even with it&rsquo;s limitations, Flex may offer solutions to a variety of difficult problems in developing Rich Internet Applications for chemistry.</p>
