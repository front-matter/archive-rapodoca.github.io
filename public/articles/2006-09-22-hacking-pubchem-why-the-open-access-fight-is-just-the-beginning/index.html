Hacking PubChem: Query by SMILES
Hacking PubChem with Ruby
Hacking NMRShiftDB

The availability of open chemical information resources like PubChem and NMRShiftDB is a very recent phenomenon, and desperately overdue. One premise of this blog is that chemical informatics is at the start of a renaissance; the chemical information revolution that started in the 1950&rsquo;s is now set to continue after a long period of stagnation. Large, open data sources, and open software that mines it, will fuel this transformation, just as they have in bioinformatics.">

<p>The availability of open chemical information resources like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->PubChem<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->NMRShiftDB<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a very recent phenomenon, and desperately overdue. One premise of this blog is that chemical informatics is at the start of a renaissance; the chemical information revolution that started in the 1950&rsquo;s is now set to continue after a long period of stagnation. Large, open data sources, and open software that mines it, will fuel this transformation, just as they have in bioinformatics.</p>
<p>The interaction of non-browser software with public databases, although rich in potential payoffs, can also lead to a great deal of damage. PubChem contains millions of structure-searchable compounds. Setting the wrong kinds of programs loose on this site could cause service interruptions ranging from the annoying to the severe.</p>
<p>There is no standard mechanism for website owners to spell out acceptable use policies to non-browser software. The closest thing we have to a standard is the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Robots Exclusion Protocol<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. This protocol defines acceptable behaviors for a robot, which according to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->one definition<!-- raw HTML omitted --> consist of: &ldquo;&hellip; a program that automatically traverses the Web&rsquo;s hypertext structure by retrieving a document, and recursively retrieving all documents that are referenced.&rdquo; Other definitions are in use. The one thing these definitions seem to have in common is the concept of scale: the more comprehensive and indiscriminate the program is in its interactions with a website, the more like a robot, and less like a browser, it becomes.</p>
<p>Site owners specify their robots policy in a file called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->robots.txt<!-- raw HTML omitted --> hosted on their servers. The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->PubChem robots.txt file<!-- raw HTML omitted --> currently includes the following policies:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-http" data-lang="http"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">User-agent: *

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Here, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->User-agent<!-- raw HTML omitted --> refers to the name of the robot, which is set as a wildcard, meaning any robot. The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Disallow<!-- raw HTML omitted --> lines refer to resources off-limits to robots.</p>
<p>One of these disallowed resources, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->/search/PreQSrv.cgi<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is explicitly used in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->PubChem SMILES query article<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Is a person who runs software of the type I describe in these articles violating PubChem&rsquo;s use policy? The best answer I can give is, &ldquo;it depends.&rdquo; I think it would be hard for reasonable people to suggest that using the software as described in the tutorials, with their deliberately limited scope, for research purposes, and with no intent to do damage, represents abuse.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I can see how reasonable people could argue that a website operating as a comprehensive front-end to PubChem using the techniques described in these articles could be considered abuse. I know I might consider it abuse if I ran PubChem, depending on why I was running the service.</p>
<p>If I wanted to stimulate innovation in the area of open database mining, I might actually encourage front ends and similar third-party PubChem services. I might set aside servers specifically dedicated to this kind of activity. I might even develop an Open Source PubChem Web-API to help developers get started. Unfortunately, NIH&rsquo;s intentions are not exactly clear on this point.</p>
<p>Looking at the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->NCBI&rsquo;s Copyright and Disclaimers page<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the only document that to my knowledge states any kind of use policy, is not especially illuminating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Conditions of Use</em></p>
<p>This site is maintained by the U.S. Government and is protected by various provisions of Title 18 of the U.S. Code. Violations of Title 18 are subject to criminal prosecution in a federal court. For site security purposes, as well as to ensure that this service remains available to all users, we use software programs to monitor traffic and to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information or otherwise cause damage. In the event of authorized law enforcement investigations and pursuant to any required legal process, information from these sources may be used to help identify an individual.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are left with the critical, but unanswered question: &ldquo;What represents an unauthorized use of PubChem?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The document cited above also raises the truly bizarre possibility of PubChem not actually being capable of granting rights to redistribute what is contained on its servers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This site also contains resources such as PubMed Central, Bookshelf, OMIM, and PubChem which incorporate material contributed or licensed by individuals, companies, or organizations that may be protected by U.S. and foreign copyright laws. &hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But this is a subject for another day.</p>
<p>Getting back to accessing PubChem data, one very far-sighted thing the NIH has done is to make the entire dataset <!-- raw HTML omitted -->freely downloadable<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in three different file formats. Rather than mine the PubChem website itself, you could download the data to your machine, letting the software you write access it locally. The sheer size of this dataset creates problems of its own. Future articles will describe some approaches to solving them.</p>
<p>Regardless of your views on the use and abuse of chemical information resources like PubChem, it&rsquo;s clear that getting open resources on the Web is only the first in a long series of controversial steps that will ultimately transform both the practice and culture of research.</p>
