<p>BioRails has a great deal of potential, and it will be interesting to see the system up close when it is released. Many areas of science, particularly chemistry, have been <!-- raw HTML omitted -->slow to embrace the Web<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as the powerful application development platform that it is. BioRails and projects like it have the potential to change not only the way that scientific software is deployed, but the nature of scientific collaboration itself.</p>
