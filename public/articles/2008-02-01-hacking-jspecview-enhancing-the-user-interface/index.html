The live applet shown above illustrates the changes that were made. As you move your mouse cursor into the spectrum area, you&rsquo;ll see a vertical red line appear and track the movements of the mouse. As you presss the mouse key to begin a selection, a grey rectangle will show you exactly where the selection area will be.">

With the preliminaries taken care of, this installment will show how to enhance the user interface.</p>
<h1 id="the-goal">The Goal</h1>
<p>The live applet shown above illustrates the changes that were made. As you move your mouse cursor into the spectrum area, you&rsquo;ll see a vertical red line appear and track the movements of the mouse. As you presss the mouse key to begin a selection, a grey rectangle will show you exactly where the selection area will be.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t view the applet, be sure you system has <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp">JDK 1.5 or higher</a> installed, and that you&rsquo;ve enabled applets for your browser.</p>
<p>Clearly, these modifications need more work. For example, you can extend the selection box outside the boundary of the spectrum area. And green might be a better color for the cursor. Then again, maybe the cursor should use an alpha channel. But I digress.</p>
<h1 id="one-more-thing">One More Thing</h1>
<p>Being a <a href="/articles/2008/01/11/my-favorite-eclipse-shortcut-quick-fix">longtime Eclipse user</a>, I prefer this tool for my Java development. So far, only the use of Ant has been described. Fortunately, Eclipse offers an elegant way to import an existing Ant project. File-&gt;New gives a dialog like the one shown below:</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/20080201/new_project.png" alt="New Project" title="New Project"></p>
<p>Selecting &ldquo;Java Project from Existing Ant Buildfile&rdquo; gives this dialog:</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/20080201/create_project.png" alt="Create Project" title="Create Project"></p>
<p>Filling in the fields as shown should give a fully-functional Eclipse project.</p>
<h1 id="still-one-more-thing">Still One More Thing</h1>
<p>If you check the HTML source for this page, you&rsquo;ll notice that the <code>applet</code> tag is used to display the applet. Yet on Internet Explorer, there is no &ldquo;click to activate&rdquo; message. The reason is that Depth-First is using the excellent JavaScript library <a href="/articles/2007/11/02/eolas-and-jactivating-working-around-a-workaround">JActivating</a>, which re-writes the <code>applet</code> tag so that it isn&rsquo;t detected by the Eolas workaround. This lets us stick with plain HTML, rather than using <code>document.write</code> to specify the applet.</p>
<h1 id="changing-the-source-code">Changing the Source Code</h1>
<p>Too many changes were made to detail individually. In general, they related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removing non-applet classes such as those involved with the desktop application.</li>
<li>Removing code flagged by Eclipse as unused.</li>
<li>Editing the <code>jspecview.common.JSVPanel</code> source to add the UI modifications. The <code>drawGraph</code>, <code>drawCursor</code>, and <code>drawZoomBox</code> methods contained most of the changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The complete Eclipse project should be <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=161398&amp;package_id=260592">available from SourceForge</a> shortly.</p>
<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
<p>Given the right tools, modifying JSpecView is not that difficult. We&rsquo;ve gone from raw souce code to a complete Eclipse project, and even added some functionality in the process.</p>
<p>Where would you like to take JSpecView?</p>
