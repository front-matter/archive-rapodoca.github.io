<p>One place to look for meaning in the term &lsquo;drug-like&rsquo; is with, well, drugs! Pharmaceutical sales figures, when combined with structural information, can provide valuable insights into drug-likeness. Unfortunately, data combining the business and science of the pharmaceutical industry as a whole are not easy to come by. Fortunately, the <a href="http://cbc.arizona.edu/njardarson/group/homepage">Njardarson group</a> at the University of Arizona has decided to take up to the challenge.</p>
<p><a href="http://cbc.arizona.edu/njardarson/group/top-pharmaceuticals-poster">Top 200 Pharmaceutical Products by Worldwide Sales in 2009</a> is a full-color table suitable for creating posters and other large displays. Each entry lists the generic name, trade name, structure, company, total sales, and indication of one top-selling drug, medical device, vaccine, or other product.</p>
<p>The Njardarson group also hosts other interesting posters at their site, including the <a href="http://cbc.arizona.edu/njardarson/group/sites/default/files/Top%20200%20Generic%20Drugs%20by%20Retail%20Dollars%20in%202008(1).pdf">top 200 generics by sales</a>.</p>
