<p>Ring perception in chemical structures is essential for a number higher-level cheminformatics operations such as <a href="/articles/2007/04/11/structure-diagram-generation">Structure Diagram Generation</a> and <a href="/articles/2007/11/28/smiles-and-aromaticity-broken">aromaticity perception</a>. Several ring perception algorithms have been developed over the last few decades, but many return only a subset of rings. Others are difficult to implement or perform badly.</p>
<p>One algorithm stands out for its ability to perceive all rings in a chemical structure, its efficiency, and its ease of implementation. In 1996, Hanser, Jauffret and Kaufmann published an <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ci960322f">algorithm for exhaustive ring perception</a> which was unfortunately not given a catchy name.</p>
<p>At the center of the Hanser algorithm is a construct called a &lsquo;P-Graph&rsquo; (short for Path Graph). A P-Graph has the useful property of retaining complete ring path information when any arbitrary node is removed. The special properties of the edges in a P-Graph ensure that ring paths are formed automatically by plucking off nodes one by one.</p>
<p>With the Hanser algorithm, the problem of perceiving all rings reduces to the problem of removing nodes from a P-Graph until none are left.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m aware of two open source implementations of the Hanser ring perception algorithm: one in the <a href="http://cdk.sf.net">Chemistry Development Kit</a>; and the other in <a href="http://sf.net/projects/octet">Octet</a>.</p>
<p>A third open source implementation of the Hanser algorithm is under construction in <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mx-java/">MX</a>, the lightweight cross-platform cheminformatics toolkit. You can watch the activity in real-time (and participate) by monitoring the <a href="http://github.com/rapodaca/mx/tree/cycle">MX &lsquo;cycle&rsquo; branch on GitHub</a>.</p>
