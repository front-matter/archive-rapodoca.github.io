<p>If you&rsquo;re involved a software project of any scale, you face the problem of collecting and acting on the numerous bugs, chores, and feature requests relating to it - and doing so in a way that promotes team collaboration. You also face the problem of estimating completion time for various phases of the project.</p>
<p>I have to admit that my solutions to these problems have been pretty pathetic in the past: PostIts, crude databases, and the like. Using systems like this, it&rsquo;s easy for things to fall through the cracks and even to lose track of what you&rsquo;re currently doing as new, higher-priority tasks come in.</p>
<p>Several months ago, I was introduced to a tool that solves all of these problems: <a href="http://pivotaltracker.com">Pivotal Tracker</a> (or just &ldquo;Tracker&rdquo;). Tracker is free, Web-based a project management tool designed around the principles of <a href="http://depth-first.com/articles/2010/09/12/scrum-in-under-ten-minutes/">Scrum</a>. There are two key benefits of this approach:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tracker forces you to think about the delivery of complex features in terms of smaller, more manageable features (stories).</li>
<li>Tracker provides the same detailed project perspective to all team members - updated in real-time, enabling them to act with less top-level control.</li>
<li>Tracker offers simple yet powerful project delivery forecasting tools.</li>
</ol>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been using Tracker in the development of <a href="http://chemwriter.com">ChemWriter 2</a> for the last couple of months now. Although Tracker&rsquo;s unique take on project management took some getting used to, it&rsquo;s become an invaluable resource. Within no time at all, our Tracker system has filled in quite nicely:</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/chemwriter-tracker.png" alt="ChemWriter Tracker" title="ChemWriter Tracker"></p>
<p>One of the hard things about using Tracker is estimating how much work will be involved in delivering a feature. For example, very recently we added a feature to ChemWriter 2 that makes it possible to join a sprouted atom by dragging it over an existing molecule atom (<a href="http://chemwriter.com/signups/new">check out the free preview</a> to see this and other features in action). Given that much of the related work consisted of porting existing Java code from ChemWriter 1.x into JavaScript, I assigned a low score. It turned out that the stark difference in rendering between ChemWriter 2 and ChemWriter 1.x made the task take about 5 times longer than originally estimated.</p>
<p>If you already use a software project management tool, Pivotal Tracker might not offer much beyond a streamlined approach to issue tracking. But if you&rsquo;re starting a new project, or are working on a project without the benefit a real project management tool, it might be worth trying Pivotal Tracker.</p>
