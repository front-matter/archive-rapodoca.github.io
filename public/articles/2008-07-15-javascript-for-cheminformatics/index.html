    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Regular readers of this blog know that one of its recurring themes is the convergence of Web technologies and chemical information. Although several articles describe how <a href="/articles/tag/ruby">Ruby</a> and <a href="/articles/tag/java">Java</a> can be applied to cheminformatics, one language has never been featured: JavaScript. JavaScript is both the default language of the Web client, and a language of growing importance <a href="/articles/2007/05/25/flex-rich-internet-applications-and-cheminformatics">elsewhere</a>. This article, the first in a series, introduces JavaScript as a tool for creating rich, chemically-oriented Web applications.</p>
<h1 id="surely-you-jest">Surely You Jest</h1>
<p>If your last exposure to JavaScript was in the 1990s, a lot has changed for the better. Most importantly, performance has increased considerably, making possible JavaScript software of considerable complexity. A growing collection of well-crafted libraries such as <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/">Prototype</a> and <a href="http://script.aculo.us/">Scriptaculous</a> now make it possible to focus precious developer effort at a higher level of abstraction. Although cross-browser compatibility continues to be an issue with browser-specific features, the JavaScript language itself is now remarkably stable and consistent across browsers and platforms.</p>
<p>JavaScript will obviously never enjoy the performance of Java or C++, and it would be a mistake to assume otherwise. The key is to focus on what JavaScript can do that no other language or platform can. With this thought in mind, it&rsquo;s interesting to speculate on the role JavaScript could play in developing Web-based software for chemistry.</p>
<p>For example, with essentially complete read-write access to the document object model (DOM) of sites on which they&rsquo;re active, tools based on JavaScript have great potential to enhance static content with content created either on a server or locally.</p>
<p>As another example, consider the combination of JavaScript and an invisible Java applet. Java-JavaScript communication is possible in all browsers through <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/LiveConnect">LiveConnect</a>, which can be used to offload computation-intensive operations from JavaScript to an applet. In many ways, this approach to development on the client resembles the approach, discussed here many times, of using Java from Ruby through <a href="/articles/tag/rjb">Ruby Java Bridge</a> (RJB) or <a href="/articles/tag/jruby">JRuby</a>.</p>
<p>Ultimately, JavaScript is the only programming language that allows cross-browser, client-side software to be written independently of a plugin. This may not sound like a big deal, but for many developers and organizations, Flash, Java, and other plugin technologies are <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-05-2008/jw-05-applets.html?page=2">less than ideal</a>.</p>
<h1 id="whats-known">What&rsquo;s Known?</h1>
<p>There are currently only scattered examples of the use of JavaScript in chemistry, an indication that either the field is ready for this idea, or that it will never work.</p>
<p>Perhaps the two best-known examples of JavaScript applied to chemical informatics are the <a href="/articles/2006/11/09/look-ma-no-applets">WebME</a> and <a href="http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/edit/">PubChem</a> chemical structure editors. Although remarkable accomplishments, both packages rely heavily on server back-ends for processing and analysis of chemical structures. The JavaScript code serves mainly to asynchronously pass low-level mouse events to the server, which then asynchronously passes a raster image back to the client. To an extent, the back and forth degrades the responsiveness of these tools.</p>
<p><a href="http://blueobelisk.sourceforge.net/wiki/Main_Page">The Blue Obelisk</a> maintains a Wiki page discussing some of the uses of <a href="http://blueobelisk.sourceforge.net/wiki/Using_Javascript_and_Greasemonkey_for_Chemistry">Greasemonkey scripts in chemistry</a>. Greasemonkey is a wonderful tool for augmenting existing Websites, and these scripts do some remarkable things, but they don&rsquo;t fall into the category of cross-browser, installation-free, general-purpose tools.</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/people/hansonr/">Robert Hanson</a> discussed <a href="http://chemapps.stolaf.edu/jmol/presentations/bcce19/hansonr-bcce19-ajax.ppt">on-demand Javascript</a> as a potential tool for building chemistry-oriented Web applications. Although the proposal contains many important points, it has to my knowledge not been followed up with the release of code.</p>
<p>An early compilation of resources can be found <a href="http://www.ch.ic.ac.uk/java/">here</a>, although all of the listed sites have since either disappeared or converted to other content.</p>
<p>Poking around the Web, it&rsquo;s possible to find many examples of one-off chemistry tools created in JavaScript. For example, <a href="http://chemistry.about.com/od/periodictables/l/bljavaperiodictable.htm">this page</a> contains a JavaScript-enabled periodic table. Useful as tools like this may be, they&rsquo;re not general-purpose solutions designed to create a platform for further work.</p>
<h1 id="what-would-be-most-valuable">What Would Be Most Valuable?</h1>
<p>There are many cheminformatics tools that could be built in JavaScript. But to be of the greatest value, a tool should be usable in a variety of contexts. And it should serve as a platform on which more complex software can be built. Even more importantly, the tool should fix something that really is <a href="/articles/tag/broken">broken</a>.</p>
<p>We might begin by asking: what makes chemical information difficult to work with in the greatest number of cases?</p>
<p>Since the earliest days of chemistry and computers, <a href="/articles/2006/09/03/peculiarities-of-chemical-information">it has been clear</a> that one of the distinguishing characteristics of chemical information is the central role played by chemical structures and the difficulty in accurately representing and processing them on machines.</p>
<p>So, one answer to the question of what would be the most useful JavaScript tool for cheminformatics could be: a low-level cheminformatics toolkit that understands chemical structures and their associated graph operations.</p>
<p>Another possibility: the handling of NMR, IR, UV, and mass spectra. <a href="/articles/tag/jspecview">JSpecView</a> is a good first choice, but it may be possible to build a pure JavaScript tool for interactively viewing and manipulating spectra, if a low-level toolkit for processing <a href="http://old.iupac.org/standing/cpep/wp_jcamp_dx.html">JCAMP-DX</a> were available.</p>
<p>Would the performance and usability of such toolkits be high enough to make them a serious choice for use in chemistry-driven Web applications? What would the availability of such a toolkit enable that is currently difficult or impossible?</p>
<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
<p>JavaScript is the default programming language of the Web client, offering a great deal to creators of chemically-oriented applications. One of the biggest barriers to using JavaScript for this purpose is the lack of key developer tools. Future articles will explore this idea.</p>
