        The Long Tail and Chemistry - Why So Many ACS Meeting Talks are &#39;Uninteresting&#39;

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>The Boston ACS provided yet another opportunity to look at chemistry as a social networking phenomenon. Having attended several talks inside my areas of expertise (organic chemistry, medicinal chemistry, and chemical informatics), I was struck by two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Most talks were laser-focused on one tiny aspect of chemistry that is of little interest to the average chemist, but of great interest to a few chemists.</li>
<li>Those talks that were not as focused on details drew the biggest crowds.</li>
</ol>
<p>These statements have nothing to do with the quality of the presentations. In fact, one of the best talks focused on the clinical trial data for a single molecule, the Type II diabetes treatment dapagliflozin (below). Although the members of the audience for this talk seemed interested as well, they represented only a tiny fraction of the ACS attendees.</p>

      <p>You can find them in nearly every scientific discipline: the anonymous science blog. For a variety of reasons, their authors have decided not to reveal their identities, as is their right. Styles range from the absolutely analytical to the cynically sarcastic.</p>
<p>I have nothing against anonymous science blogs. Some of the most interesting writing I&rsquo;ve seen has been posted to them. But I do have some reasons why you might want to think twice before starting one.</p>

        Five Ways to Use PubChem Right Now

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>You&rsquo;ve heard the hype about <a href="http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">PubChem</a>, but you&rsquo;re still not convinced. In your mind, the fans have yet to show anything that PubChem does to make your job (which is to get stuff done in the lab) any easier. You&rsquo;ve got <a href="http://www.cas.org/SCIFINDER/">SciFinder</a>, which does everything you need to do. Why bother with this free Internet thing?</p>
<p>New technologies need to prove themselves. Those that don&rsquo;t simply disappear, or morph into something whose value is more apparent. With these thoughts in mind, here are five things chemists everywhere can use PubChem for right now.</p>

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>A series of D-F articles have discussed <a href="http://inchimatic.com">InChIMatic</a>, a Web application that lets you structure-search the Web using popular search engines such as Google. Recent articles have also described Firefly, a lightweight 2D structure editor designed especially for the Web.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/20070815/screenshot.png" alt="Firefly" title="Firefly"></p>
<p>Today, the first alpha release of Firefly is available for use with <a href="http://inchimatic.com">InChIMatic</a>.</p>
<p>Despite its small size of only 103K, the Firefly applet offers a number of advanced features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A clean interface with major functionality in plain sight.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Antialiased rendering.</strong> Pressing the &ldquo;+&rdquo; and &ldquo;-&rdquo; keys will zoom in and out to reveal rendering detail.</li>
<li><strong>User-overridable bond length and angle constraints.</strong> When dragging a bond, use <em>Shift</em> to relax both angle and length constraints, or <em>Ctrl</em> to relax only angle constraints.</li>
<li><strong>Automatic inside-outside double bond rendering.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Built-in molfile import/export.</strong> Use the File-&gt;Import Molfile and File-&gt;Export Molfile options to copy/paste a molfile from your system clipboard.</li>
<li><strong>Automatic implicit hydrogen detection.</strong> The quadrant for hydrogen placement is chosen based on the bonds surrounding the atom.</li>
<li><strong>Twenty levels of undo/redo.</strong> The commands can either be issued from the menu, or <em>Ctrl-Z</em>/<em>Ctrl-Y</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Persistent molecule.</strong> When you visit another page and come back, Firefly remembers the molecule you were working on.</li>
<li><strong>No digital certificate authorization.</strong> Just start using it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Firefly also incorporates a number of keyboard shortcuts to speed up structure drawing:</p>

      <p>Both <a href="http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">PubChem</a> and the <a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do">Protein Data Bank</a> (PDB) maintain vast collections of molecular data. Individual users are free to view and search these collections via standard Web browsers. But what are the options if you&rsquo;re developing software to interact with these databases?</p>
<p>Various application programming interfaces (APIs) are available for accessing PubChem and PDB records. For example, PubChem recently introduced its <a href="/articles/tag/pug">Power User Gateway</a> (PUG), an XML-based query language. But writing APIs is extremely difficult; reconciling the need for simplicity with the need for rich functionality is a tough balancing act. Where do you draw the line?</p>

        James Gosling Unplugged
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Earlier this week, James Gosling <a href="/articles/2007/07/31/conversations-with-james">fielded a variety of questions</a> from the San Diego Java Users&rsquo; Group. Subjects ranged from the deeply technical to the ridiculously political, and the entire event was simply great. Here, in no particular order, were some of the highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Question: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your least favorite word?&rdquo; Answer: &ldquo;Action Item.&rdquo; My kind of guy.</li>
<li>Virtually all banking transactions on the planet are processed by Java code.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.nasdaq.com/aspx/iishome.aspx?">NASDAQ</a> is a single computer running a Java program.</li>
<li>Backward compatibility in Java is a huge problem; everything in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->rt.jar<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is used by someone somewhere so nothing can be taken out. The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Calendar<!-- raw HTML omitted --> class is the overengineered monstrosity that it is because there are people, such as those building historical databases, who absolutely need it.</li>
<li>The decision whether to include a library in core Java is deeply political. Having your organization&rsquo;s library in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->rt.jar<!-- raw HTML omitted --> apparently carries a great deal of prestige, a fact that has bedeviled efforts to pare down core Java.</li>
<li>The reason we have JDK 1.4, 1.5, and 1.6 rather than 4, 5, and 6 is that the contracts Sun negotiated 10+ years ago with its partners required renegotiation if the major revision were ever incremented. It was easier to just never increment the major revision.</li>
<li>SWT was a major sore spot. Looks like Gosling&rsquo;s going to have the <a href="http://depth-first.com/articles/2007/07/18/building-a-molecule-preview-with-firefly-the-joy-of-swing">last laugh</a> after all, though.</li>
<li>Sau Paulo has two Java users&rsquo; groups of about 6,000 members each. Their meetings regularly draw 1000+ attendees. According to Gosling, Brazil is one of the world&rsquo;s software hotspots.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these things certainly seem plausible, but others less so. If you&rsquo;ve got any information one way or the other, I&rsquo;d like to hear from you.</p>

      <p>Depth-First began with a single post on August 12th, 2006. One year and 193 posts later, I thought it would be interesting to reflect back on how my expectations about blogging diverged from reality.  Many of my observations come from statistics compiled by <a href="http://google.com/analytics">Google Analytics</a>. An investment in time to install and use analytics software more than pays for itself within a few weeks.</p>
<p>With these thoughts in mind, here are ten things that surprised me:</p>

        Never Draw the Same Molecule Twice: Viewing Image Metadata

      <p>Chemists are accustomed to embedding live molecular objects in their documents with Microsoft Word/ChemDraw. These objects can then be reprocessed and embedded into other documents, such as PowerPoint presentations, saving enormous amounts of time.

<p>A <a href="/articles/2007/08/01/never-draw-the-same-molecule-twice-image-metadata-for-cheminformatics">recent D-F article</a> proposed a method to encode molecular structure data within commonly-used Web image formats such as PNG. That article contained an embedded image of GlaxoSmithKline&rsquo;s diabetes treatment rosiglitazone (Avandia) encoded by a rendering toolkit built with <a href="/articles/tag/firefly">Firefly</a>. I claimed that this image contained the complete connection table and atom coordinates as embedded metadata. In this article, I&rsquo;ll show a simple method to read this metadata.</p>
