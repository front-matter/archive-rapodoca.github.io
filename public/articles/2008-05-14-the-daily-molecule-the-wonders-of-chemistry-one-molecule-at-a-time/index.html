    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Chemistry is a big field judged by any standard, including the <a href="/articles/2008/05/07/1908-and-all-that-the-long-tail-and-chemistry">proliferation of American Chemical Society (ACS) divisions</a>. Each subdiscipline in chemistry is in turn so big, that once a chemist becomes &lsquo;differentiated&rsquo; it&rsquo;s easy to lose touch even with neighboring subdisciplines. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be that way. This article introduces a new service, <a href="http://blog.chempedia.com"><em>The Daily Molecule</em></a> designed to make it just a little bit easier (and hopefully fun) to stay in the chemical loop.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-it">What Is It?</h1>
<p>The idea is simple: every weekday, a new molecule will be featured on <em>The Daily Molecule</em> with a short write-up and some leading references. Although molecules in the news will get first priority, any molecule is fair game.</p>
<p>The material for <em>The Daily Molecule</em> will be drawn from <a href="http://chempedia.com">Chempedia</a>, which in turn gets some of its content from <a href="http://wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>. In other words, the entries on the Daily Molecule will be largeley written by my fellow chemists.</p>
<p>The process of creating a <em>Daily Molecule</em> entry is not time-consuming, but much of what is being done manually now could be automated in the future. The technology platform lends itself well to many forms of chemistry-specific modification (see below).</p>
<p>I hesitate to use the term &lsquo;blog&rsquo; to describe <em>The Daily Molecule</em>, but the description may be helpful to an extent.</p>
<p><em>The Daily Molecule</em> is unlike a blog in that most content will be generated by others, selected by some criteria, reformatted for consistency, and published. In that sense, <em>The Daily Molecule</em> is a something like a mini scientific journal, but it turns the process of acquiring content on its head.</p>
<p>If chemistry ever evolves beyond the <a href="/articles/2007/07/16/go-west-young-man-does-open-access-really-matter-in-the-long-run">current model of publication</a>, which seems inevitable at this point, the journals of the future may resemble <em>The Daily Molecule</em> in one or more ways.</p>
<h1 id="technology">Technology</h1>
<p>The software running <em>The Daily Molecule</em> is a modified version of <a href="http://simplelog.net/">SimpleLog</a>, a Web application based on <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>. Unlike most blogging engines, SimpleLog focuses on implementing only the most basic publication features, and doing them to perfection. If you know a little Ruby and can work with Rails, you can do a lot with SimpleLog.</p>
<p>One of the first items of business will be to implement <a href="/articles/2007/09/18/six-reasons-i-like-recaptcha-or-how-to-build-a-web-service-worth-talking-about">reCAPTCHA</a> support and activate comments on articles.</p>
<p>Some ideas for chemically-enabling <em>The Daily Molecule</em> include a graphical abstract sidebar and (sub)structure search. Currently, the 2D chemical structure images posted to <em>The Daily Molecule</em> <a href="/articles/2007/08/08/never-draw-the-same-molecule-twice-viewing-image-metadata">have complete connection tables embedded as metadata</a>, a feature with some interesting possibilities.</p>
<h1 id="the-molecule-of-the-dayweekmonth">The Molecule of the Day/Week/Month</h1>
<p>The basic idea behind <em>The Daily Molecule</em> is not new. Many other services have sprung up over the last ten years that operate, at least on the surface, similarly. Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.moleculeoftheday.com/">Molecule of the Day</a></li>
<li><a href="http://portal.acs.org/portal/acs/corg/content?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=PP_TRANSITIONMAIN&amp;node_id=677&amp;use_sec=false&amp;sec_url_var=region1">ACS Molecule of the Week</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.drugsandpoisons.com/">Drugs and Poisons</a></li>
<li><a href="http://the-half-decent-pharmaceutical-chemistry-blog.chemblogs.org/category/saturday-night-synthesis">Saturday Night Synthesis</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/motm/motm.htm">The Molecule of the Month</a> (may be the oldest continuously-operated MOTM site in existence)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.3dchem.com/motm.asp">3dchem.com Molecule of the Month</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.expasy.org/spotlight/">Protein Spotlight</a></li>
<li><a href="http://mgl.scripps.edu/people/goodsell/illustration/pdb">PDB Molecule of the Month</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.prous.com/molecules/default.asp">Prous Molecule of the Month</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Quite a few others don&rsquo;t appear on this list.</p>
<p>The different idea behind the <em>The Daily Molecule</em> is that chemical content already exists in on the Web in machine-readable format with licenses that permit its re-use; all that&rsquo;s needed is a way to aggregate, format, and package that information in a form suitable for once-daily scanning and cheminformatics manipulation.</p>
<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
<p>Like no other medium, the Web blurs artificial distinctions: between work and play; between private and public; between on-topic and off-topic; between fame and obscurity; between mine and yours; between big and small; and between profit and non-profit. Chemistry may be late to the party, but is not immune to its call.</p>
