For example, nothing puts the brakes on a search faster than finding a reference to a key paper, but being unable to download it due to the access policies of the hosting journal.</p>
<p>Enter <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ChemRefer<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The site works very simply: type in a keyword and get a list of papers matching it somewhere in the article. Click on one of the search results links, and you&rsquo;ll get the entire article as a PDF file.</p>
<p>What makes this remarkable is that most of ChemRefer&rsquo;s holdings appear to come from copyrighted, subscription-only journals. For example, searching for &ldquo;taxol&rdquo; produces links to the full PDFs for papers published in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tetrahedron Letters.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Org. Letters<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->J. Med. Chem.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, among others.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear whether ChemRefer is legally or illegally redistributing these articles. The results are not comprehensive, indicating some form of pre-selection. The journals in question are known for their tough copyright stance and high prices, so there may be a problem regardless of how the material was originally obtained. ChemRefer&rsquo;s founder, William James Griffiths was interviewed on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Reactive Reports<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about his service.</p>
<p>Regardless of the legal status of its holdings, ChemRefer offers an intriguing window into another world. What wonders might result if independent Internet services could mash-up the primary literature at will?</p>
