<h1 id="origins-reactionmate">Origins: ReactionMate</h1>
<p><a href="http://metamolecular.com/reactionmate-app/">ReactionMate</a> (<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reactionmate/id524541263?mt=8">App Store</a>) at the moment is a little iOS app with big ambitions. It aims to become a useful companion to anyone studying, performing, or using chemical reactions.</p>
<p>One of the fundamental requirements for processing chemical reactions computationally is the automatic balancing of chemical equations, a function ReactionMate performs relatively well.</p>
<p>Given this foundation, there are many interesting directions the app could be taken, both in education and research. Hopefully, I&rsquo;ll be discussing some of them later.</p>
<p>When I started working on ReactionMate, my main motivation was to better learn iOS development with Objective-C. A reaction balancer, so I thought, would be an easy project.</p>
<p>Although I did reach the first milestone and now have an app for sale to show for the effort, the path was much longer and darker than I imagined.</p>
<h1 id="balancing-by-inspection">Balancing By Inspection</h1>
<p>You may remember back to learning how to balance chemical equations in General Chemistry. A  common method still taught is known as <em>balancing by inspection</em>. This explanation from Khan Academy is typical:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Although a fine approach for balancing simple equations by hand, balancing by inspection does not lend itself well to use in a software algorithm. I suspect that the same thing that makes balancing by inspection so difficult for students to master is the same thing that makes it unsuitable for use as algorithm: it&rsquo;s hit or miss and then try again.</p>
<h1 id="balancing-with-matricieslinear-algebra">Balancing With Matricies/Linear Algebra</h1>
<p>A more general and deterministic method for balancing chemical equations uses linear algebra. Given the constraint that the number of atoms of a given type on the left of the equation must equal the number of that type of atom on the right, it&rsquo;s possible to set up a system of linear equations and use matrix operations to solve for coefficients. The video below shows how this works conceptually:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h1 id="issues">Issues</h1>
<p>Implementing the necessary matrix algebra in Objective-C was not terribly difficult in a first pass. Coefficients for the first few chemical equations were found without problems.</p>
<p>However, as the number and complexity of tested equations grew, problems began to surface - each demanding a solution. The next installment will discuss some of the issues and how they were addressed.</p>
<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
<p>Balancing chemical equations is a deep topic at the intersection between mathematics and chemistry. Balanced chemical equations also lie at the heart of many important areas in chemistry. With academic papers appearing as recently as a couple of years ago, this topic is full of surprises.</p>
