    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->NMR Prediction software can be a useful tool in spectral assignment and unknown identification. Until recently, the only available software consisted of rather expensive desktop-based packages. But a new Web service called <a href="http://nmrdb.org">nmrdb.org</a> looks ready to change that.</p>
<h1 id="about-nmrdborg">About nmrdb.org</h1>
<p><a href="http://nmrdb.org">nmrdb.org</a> is actually three services in one: <a href="http://www.nmrdb.org/resurector">NMR Resurrector</a>; <a href="http://www.nmrdb.org/nemo">NMR Assigner</a>; and <a href="http://www.nmrdb.org/predictor">NMR Predictor</a>.</p>
<p>NMR Resurector is a remarkable tool that re-creates a proton NMR plot from tabulated peak frequencies. Output is available in PDF, and PNG image format.</p>
<p>NMR Assigner enables the interactive correlation of the atoms of a molecule with the peaks in a spectrum. Output is available in ACS format ready for inclusion in manuscripts, or as a text table.</p>
<p>NMR Predictor generates a complete proton NMR spectrum from an arbitrary chemical structure provided as a molfile or drawn with a structure editor. An interactive display (similar in concept to one <a href="/articles/2008/02/06/the-chemically-enabled-user-interface-an-introduction-to-leafcutter">discussed here recently</a>) highlights both the atom giving rise to a signal and the signal itself in response to hovering with the mouse. Output is available in both PDF and PNG image format.</p>
<p>With each of nmrdb&rsquo;s services, a precompiled set of data can be used as a way to become familiar with what the service can do.</p>
<h1 id="nmrdborg-a-web-service">nmrdb.org a Web Service</h1>
<p>Although useful as a standalone tool, NMR Resurector could be even more powerful when used as a Web service in combination with other Web applications. As a hint of the kinds of things that might be possible, nmrdb is capable of creating a predicted spectrum through a special URL into which a SMILES string is embedded. For example, click on the structure of cholesterol below (or use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this link)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nmrdb.org/predictor?smiles=CC%28C%29CCC%5BC%40%40H%5D%28C%29%5BC%40H%5D1CC%5BC%40%40H%5D2%5BC%40%40%5D1%28CC%5BC%40H%5D3%5BC%40H%5D2CC%3DC4%5BC%40%40%5D3%28CC%5BC%40%40H%5D%28C4%29O%29C%29C"><img src="/images/posts/20080520/cholesterol.png" alt="Cholesterol" title="Cholesterol"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://chemspider.com">ChemSpider</a> has added this capability to its compound summary pages under the link &ldquo;NMR&rdquo;.</p>
<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
<p>nmrdb.org is a very well thought-out service that could be of immediate benefit to chemists and developers alike. It also demonstrates that <a href="/articles/2007/01/24/thirty-two-free-chemistry-databases">creating databases</a> is but one way to chemically enable the Web.</p>
