<p>JavaScript, that language that for years was written off as a toy at best and an abomination at worst, is now much better understood. It turns out JavaScript is quite powerful and surprisingly well-designed, provided that you stick to the <a href="/articles/2009/09/11/tech-fridays-javascript-the-good-parts">good parts</a> and avoid the bad parts.</p>
<p>But how do you do BDD in JavaScript? One tool I was pleasantly surprised with is <a href="http://github.com/nkallen/screw-unit">Screw.Unit</a>.  If you&rsquo;ve ever worked with <a href="http://rspec.info/">RSpec</a>, you&rsquo;ll immediately recognize the connection. The ability to create nested contexts and tests that read like plain English makes this my JavaScript testing tool of choice.</p>
