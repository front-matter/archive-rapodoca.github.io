    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Developing a network of contacts is often cited as career advice to chemists. Sometimes, LinkedIn is <a href="https://cen.acs.org/articles/90/i45/SUPPORT.html">suggested</a> as a good service for doing so.</p>
<p>A recent post describing why one user <a href="http://blog.capwatkins.com/quitting-linkedin">quit LinkedIn</a> altogether got me thinking about how useful this service is in practice. An older D-F post talked about some <a href="http://depth-first.com/articles/2010/06/29/linkedin-forums-how-do-i-despise-thee-let-me-count-the-ways/">problems with LinkedIn forums</a> - specifically, the limitations of investing time and effort on closed discussion forums with a limited audience.</p>
<p>Given the currently <a href="http://depth-first.com/articles/2012/12/19/the-manic-depressive-chemistry-jobs-market-a-24-year-perspective/">underperforming chemistry job market</a>, and the often-cited connection between LinkedIn and finding a job, it seems reasonable to ask chemists - what has LinkedIn done for you lately?</p>
<p>What better way to <a href="https://twitter.com/rapodaca/status/288372461580455936">ask</a> than with that other social media site, Twitter. Responses have so far been mixed. Here&rsquo;s a sample:</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve successfully used LinkedIn to land a chemistry position or solve a technical problem you faced in your job, how did you do it? If another service or approach gave better results, which one did you use and how?</p>
