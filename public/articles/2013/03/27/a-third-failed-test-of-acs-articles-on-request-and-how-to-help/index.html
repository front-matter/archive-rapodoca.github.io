    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>A <a href="/articles/2013/03/26/a-second-failed-test-of-acs-articles-on-request/">previous post</a> detailed my failed attempt to test a rather interesting if not well-known program offered by ACS to corresponding publication authors: &ldquo;free access&rdquo; to final published articles after 12 months under the <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/page/policy/articlesonrequest/index.html">Articles on Request</a> (AoR) program.</p>
<p>In that post I made a mistake that I&rsquo;ll attempt to correct here. Although it doesn&rsquo;t affect my conclusion - that the AoR unlimited &ldquo;free access&rdquo; provision doesn&rsquo;t seem to work after 12 months - my mistake does affect those who are trying to repeat my observations.</p>
<p>My mistake was not checking the publication date for the AoR article links I tested. The articles were less than one year old and so are still under the 50-download quota, which is not the part of AoR that&rsquo;s under discussion.</p>
<p>The AoR links that need to be tested instead are for papers more than one year old. From <a href="http://hutchison.chem.pitt.edu/people/prof-hutchison/">Geoff Hutchison&rsquo;s page</a>, the only candidates are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://pubs.acs.org/articlesonrequest/AOR-MhutKByEQwq6x9Ih7w52">J. Phys. Chem. C 2011 115(35) 17558-17563</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pubs.acs.org/articlesonrequest/AOR-am3ChJSdhUjFc8uEPjKq">J. Phys. Chem. C 2011 115(32) 16200-16210</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pubs.acs.org/articlesonrequest/AOR-7IpprGJg3RgyC2mywv53">J. Phys. Chem. C 2010 114(48) 20417-20423</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Using the first link as an example, on Chrome 26.0.1410.40 beta under OS X Lion I was redirected to the following <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp2047085?journalCode=jpccck">page</a> when logged in with my ACS ID:</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/acs-aor-paywall.png" alt="ACS AOR Paywall" title="ACS AOR Paywall"></p>
<p>Clicking on the &ldquo;Hi-Res PDF&rdquo; link reloaded the <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/jp2047085">paywall page</a>. Logging out of my ACS account and trying the link again sent me to a login screen. After logging in I was directed to another <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/jp2047085">paywall page</a>.</p>
<p>Running the same test with Internet Explorer 9 under Windows Vista redirected to a different <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/jp2047085">page</a>, but with a paywall firmly in place nevertheless:</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/acs-aor-paywall-ie.png" alt="ACS AOR Paywall IE" title="ACS AOR Paywall IE"></p>
<p>There are three simple things you could do to help me get to the bottom of this mystery:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on one of the three J. Phys. Chem. C links above from a computer without access to that journal&rsquo;s content.</li>
<li>Let me know if you were able to get to the full article content and whether you had to use an ACS ID to get it.</li>
<li>Send me an AoR link to a paper published more than one year ago in a journal other than J. Phys. Chem. C to test.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ACS Articles on Request &ldquo;free access&rdquo; provision didn&rsquo;t work as advertised in my hands for papers published more than 12 months ago. I&rsquo;m sorry for any confusion resulting from my previous post and hope that the information contained here offers a better basis for discussion.</p>
