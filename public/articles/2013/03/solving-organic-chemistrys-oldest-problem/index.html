    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>According to <a href="http://www.orgsyn.org/orgsyn/pdfs/v88p0001.pdf">a recent editorial by Rick Danheiser</a>, 3-5% of the procedures submitted for review by <a href="http://www.orgsyn.org/">Organic Syntheses</a> are rejected &ldquo;due to the inability of the checkers to satisfactorily reproduce the results of their submitters.&rdquo; During the period 1982-2005 the rejection rate was about 12%.</p>
<p><em>Organic Syntheses</em> was <a href="http://www.orgsyn.org/about.asp">founded</a> to address organic chemistry&rsquo;s oldest and most persistent problem - documenting and reproducing synthetic procedures. From Danheiser&rsquo;s editorial, it&rsquo;s clear that more work, and possibly a better approach, is needed.</p>
<h1 id="worse-than-it-looks">Worse Than It Looks</h1>
<p>A failure rate of 3-12% may sound small, but consider the pool from which <em>Organic Syntheses</em> draws. To even be <a href="http://www.orgsyn.org/submission.html">considered</a> for checking in the lab of an <a href="http://orgsyn.org/boe.asp">Editorial Board member</a>, a <a href="http://www.orgsyn.org/OS_Proposal_Cover_Sheet.pdf">proposal outline</a> must first be submitted by an outside author. If the proposal meets the standards of the board, a full procedure is invited. Another round of review then takes place. Only if approved by the board will the procedure be checked.</p>
<p>This rigorous pre-screening process means that authors must have a great deal of confidence in a submitted procedure <em>before</em> it&rsquo;s checked. The denominator in the figure Danheiser cites most likely represents the very best of what organic synthesis can offer.</p>
<p>Despite this rigorous selection and review process, 3-12% of procedures have historically failed the <em>Organic Syntheses</em> reproducibility test. Why?</p>
<p>Danheiser&rsquo;s editorial ends with a teaser: &ldquo;Part 2 of this editorial will discuss the most common causes of problems based on the experiences of the Board of Editors.&rdquo; Unfortunately, this follow-up doesn&rsquo;t appear to have been published yet.</p>
<h1 id="solving-the-problem">Solving the Problem</h1>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><em>Organic Syntheses</em> has co-evolved over the last several decades alongside the peer-reviewed scientific publication system. But with the widespread use of the Web and other information technologies, that system is <a href="/articles/2012/01/28/george-whitesides-the-concept-of-the-scientific-paper-is-eroding-before-our-very-eyes/">changing</a> - fast.</p>
<p>Could there be a fundamentally faster and more efficient way to publish and vet synthetic organic procedures than the system we have now?</p>
<p>Despite some <a href="/articles/2013/02/22/anonymous-science-and-the-survival-of-blogsyn/">points to consider</a>, the <a href="http://blog-syn.blogspot.com/">Blog Syn</a> initiative and others likely to follow have a chance to make significant inroads into organic chemistry&rsquo;s oldest problem.</p>
