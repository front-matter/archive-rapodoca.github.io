<p>Like Sigma-Aldrich&rsquo;s <a href="http://depth-first.com/articles/2007/10/11/open-access-business-models-that-can-actually-work-sigma-aldrichs-chemblogs">ChemBlogs</a>, Reaction Search matches the needs of a for-profit company to attract customers with the needs of chemists for unrestricted free access to research tools. Could this be the shape of things to come?</p>
<p>The parallels to Aldrich&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/cgi-bin/hsrun/Suite7/Suite/Suite.hjx;start=Suite.HsEgrailForm.run?FormName=AldrichHandbook0708_87244">Handbook</a> are striking. Few bench chemists today regularly use a <a href="http://www.hbcpnetbase.com/">CRC Handbook</a>, yet nearly all of them have a copy of the Aldrich catalog at their desks. Aldrich seems to get this simple idea like no other company. And they&rsquo;re quietly transferring this understanding to the Web.</p>
