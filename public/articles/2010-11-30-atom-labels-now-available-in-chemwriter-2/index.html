<p>Correctly scaling and placing atom labels is one of the most difficult parts of writing a chemical structure editor. With its <a href="http://chemwriter.com/signups/new">latest preview release</a>, ChemWriter 2 has crossed this barrier.</p>
<p>For the unfamiliar, ChemWriter 2 is a pure JavaScript chemical structure editor that can be embedded in web pages without any browser plugins. ChemWriter 2 runs on all major modern browsers and a number of legacy browsers as well, including Internet Explorer 7/8.</p>
<p>Unlike Java, which has a vast array of utilities for manipulating fonts and glyphs, JavaScript&rsquo;s support for this kind of thing is extremely limited. <a href="/articles/2010/11/22/google-closure-building-complex-applications-with-javascript/">The Closure Library</a> offers low-level support in the form of abstract shape operations, but little in the way of manipulating characters in a graphical context. The way we addressed this limitation may be the subject of future posts.</p>
<p>As  you can see from the screenshot, we&rsquo;ve got a lot of the functionality in place now, but there&rsquo;s still some work to do. For example, implicit hydrogens and charges are not displayed. And if you look carefully, you&rsquo;ll notice that atom labels are slightly off-center, to the right, along the x-axis. Fortunately, we have a lightweight, fully-functional chemical structure editor written in Java (<a href="http://chemwriter.com">ChemWriter 1.x</a>) from which to port additional features and refinements.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve <a href="http://chemwriter.com/signups/new">signed up for the demo</a>, atom labels can be added by hovering over an atom of interest and <a href="http://chemwriter.com/articles/keyboard-shortcuts">using the same element keyboard shortcuts introduced in ChemWriter 1.x</a>. We&rsquo;ll be introducing the ability to add elements from the rest of the periodic table shortly.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a Web-based structure editor designed for the future but runnable today, I&rsquo;d like to <a href="http://metamolecular.com/contact">hear from you</a>.</p>
