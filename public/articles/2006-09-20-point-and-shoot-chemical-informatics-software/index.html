    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>One of my favorite software-related blogs is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Signal to Noise<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It&rsquo;s contributors are employees of the web application company <!-- raw HTML omitted -->37signals<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, one of whom is the founder of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ruby on Rails<!-- raw HTML omitted --> project. This company is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->very<!-- raw HTML omitted --> focused on its customers, and it shows. The information here ranges from software development strategies to product design.</p>
<p>A recent article discusses the concept of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->point and shoot software<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The idea is simple: most people most of the time just want to take a picture. A point and shoot camera is exactly what they need, thus their popularity. People don&rsquo;t care if the exposure isn&rsquo;t exactly right or if the depth of field is too wide. Many of them know that if they had used an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SLR<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and had taken the time to really set the shot up, that the result would be better. But they can&rsquo;t fit one of those things in their pocket. Even if they could, by the time they had configured it, the spontaneous moment they wanted to photograph would be gone.</p>
<p>I suspect that many users of software (both developers and scientists) just want the equivalent of a point-and-shoot camera. This is where a concise, dynamic language like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ruby<!-- raw HTML omitted --> really shines. It&rsquo;s one reason why semantically limited molecular file formats, like Molfile V2000, remain so popular. It&rsquo;s the reason <!-- raw HTML omitted -->lightweight, fast applications with a limited number of features and zero installation<!-- raw HTML omitted --> can mean the difference between an idea tested and an idea forgotten.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t think this applies to you? Take this test: when was the last time you used Google&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->advanced search options<!-- raw HTML omitted -->?</p>
<p>Of course, there will always be a small number of users that need something more powerful. But most users, most of the time, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->neither want nor need<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the &ldquo;technologically superior&rdquo; option. The guys at 37signals say you can&rsquo;t please both camps at the same time. Why should chemical informatics software be any different?</p>
