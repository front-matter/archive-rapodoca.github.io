For source documents, see the official American Chemical Society v. Leadscope record. For background presented earlier here, see:

The ACS Versus Leadscope Case The story begins with three former Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) employees who leave to form their own software company - Leadscope. On being granted a U.S. patent for their software, Leadscope is sued by ACS.
ACS Loses $27 Million Case Against Leadscope On winning the case against them, Leadscope countersues the ACS - and wins big.
ACS Versus Leadscope - Leadscope Tells Its Story in Court Document This story, told from the perspective of Leadscope through documents filed with the Ohio Supreme Court, documents in a very approachable manner the Ohio jury&rsquo;s findings.
ACS Appeals Leadscope Case to Ohio Supreme Court Announcement that the court would hear the case. At this point it&rsquo;s important to remember that the ACS does not dispute the  activities Leadscope accused them of. They are instead disputing the size of punitive damages and their legal underpinning.
The Elephant in the Room: Should Chemical Abstracts Service Become a For-Profit Company? 80% of ACS revenues come from &rsquo;electronic services&rsquo;, of which CAS is a major component. Member dues total a mere 2.6%.
