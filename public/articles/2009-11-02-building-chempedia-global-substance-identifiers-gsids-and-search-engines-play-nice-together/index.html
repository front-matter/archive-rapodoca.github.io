<p>Over at the <a href="http://products.metamolecular.com/chempedia">Chempedia Newsfeed</a>, I&rsquo;ve posted an article discussing the recently-started <a href="http://products.metamolecular.com/2009/11/02/googling-for-substances-with-chempedia-global-substance-identifiers-gsids">indexing of Chempedia GSIDs by Google</a>, and its significance. To summarize, GSIDs offer a powerful new way to link your own Web content into a larger system of chemical substance information.</p>
