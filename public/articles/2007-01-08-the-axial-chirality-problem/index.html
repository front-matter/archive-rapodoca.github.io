<p>Axial chirality results, not from a tetrahedral chiral center, but from a chiral axis. This form of chirality most frequently occurs in biaryls and allenes. The importance of axial chirality to organic chemistry was recognized in 2001, when Ryoji Noyori was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->co-awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, in part for his work with highly selective catalysts derived from the axially-chiral BINAP ligand.</p>
<p>Since the early 1980s, axial chirality has played an increasingly significant role in organic chemistry. Much of this research has focused on catalysis; consider two recent reviews, one on modified <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BINOLs<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and one on modified <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BINAPs<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. But axial chirality isn&rsquo;t just restricted to catalysts; it&rsquo;s also a feature of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->numerous natural products<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Once merely a curiosity, axial chirality now plays a role in virtually every subdiscipline of organic chemistry. At the same time, this important concept is alien to most molecular languages and toolkits. Consider, for example, that the specifications of all four of the most popular molecular languages (SMILES, InChI, Molfile, and CML) are silent on the representation of axial chirality. In other words, axial chirality is undefined in these languages. Although support for axial chirality could be &ldquo;hacked&rdquo; into these languages, this would require nonstandard conventions that would be unintelligible to any third party.</p>
<p>This situation poses a significant problem for those needing to discriminate axially chiral stereoisomers in molecular databases or other applications. For example, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->PubChem&rsquo;s entry on the axially-chiral drug gossypol<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is devoid of stereochemical information. If PubChem used an internal representation of molecular structure capable of encoding axial chirality, coupled with a suitable molecular language to be used by depositors, separate entries for each gossypol enantiomer would be feasible. After all, PubChem users have come to expect the same of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->other chiral drugs containing stereogenic atoms<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>To address this problem, a new XML-based molecular language called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FlexMol<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has been developed. Recent articles have highlighted FlexMol&rsquo;s use with the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->multi-atom bonding found in metallocenes<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->E/Z alkene geometrical isomerism<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Based on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a specification by Andreas Dietz<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, Flexmol can represent all forms of axial chirality using a single flexible formalism..</p>
<p>Chemical informatics is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->beginning to embrace<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the concepts of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Open Source<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Open Data<!-- raw HTML omitted --> already in widespread use elsewhere. This shift will bring into sharp focus the need for robust and open methods for accurately encoding molecular structure. Existing technologies have not kept up with the chemists themselves, as the axial chirality problem demonstrates. Future articles in this series will show how FlexMol can offer a solution to this and other important molecular representation problems.</p>
