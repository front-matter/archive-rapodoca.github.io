    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p><a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a>, the group that brought intellectual property licensing to the masses, has recently spun off a new group - <a href="http://ownterms.org">OwnTerms</a>. The new effort is &ldquo;intended as a clearinghouse for Creative Commons-licensed stock legal documents. Documents like web site terms and conditions, speaker contracts, simple web design contracts and so on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever worked day and night to launch your new Web application only to break out in a cold sweat when discovering you need <a href="http://www.ownterms.org/documents/terms-of-service/">Terms of Service</a> and <a href="http://www.ownterms.org/documents/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a> documents, OwnTerms may be just what you&rsquo;ve been waiting for.</p>
<p>In the brief time OwnTerms has been in operation they&rsquo;ve already added two new templates: <a href="http://ownterms.pbwiki.com/Speaker-Agreement">Speaker Agreement</a> and <a href="http://ownterms.pbwiki.com/">Audio-Visual Recording Release</a>. These are works in progress and are community-editable - Wikipedia-style.</p>
<p>Good legal advice costs money, and I doubt OwnTerms suggests that you can now fire your lawyer. On the other hand, many law firms operate on a model of redistributing, customizing and supporting their own firms&rsquo; legal templates. At the very least, having a template in hand can provide a more productive beginning your next legal conversation.</p>
