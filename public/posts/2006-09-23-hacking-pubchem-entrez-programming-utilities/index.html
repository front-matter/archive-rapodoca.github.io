<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Peter Corbett<!-- raw HTML omitted --> writes to point out that the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Entrez Programming Utilities<!-- raw HTML omitted --> can be used to query PubChem and other databases under the NIH/NCI/NCBI umbrella. A separate developer server processes requests, and the terms of its use are fairly well stated. Future articles will explore the possibility of building some simple Ruby APIs for this developer PubChem entry point.</p>
