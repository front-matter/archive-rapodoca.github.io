Finding a Home
Before setting up your Open Source project, you&rsquo;ll need to decide on how to host it. Project hosting can be as simple or elaborate as you wish, but the basic services include: a website; a mailing list; a discussion forum; a source code repository (typically CVS or Subversion); a bug tracking system; and a file release system.">

In this article, the first in a series, I&rsquo;ll go beyond the Ruby code to discuss the technical aspects of taking an Open Source idea from concept to release.</p>
<h1 id="finding-a-home">Finding a Home</h1>
<p>Before setting up your Open Source project, you&rsquo;ll need to decide on how to host it. Project hosting can be as simple or elaborate as you wish, but the basic services include: a website; a mailing list; a discussion forum; a source code repository (typically CVS or Subversion); a bug tracking system; and a file release system.</p>
<p>The multitude of choices can be broken down into two basic options: host the project yourself or use a free hosting service. Fortunately, Ruby-based projects enjoy two excellent free hosting options: <a href="http://sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a> and <a href="http://rubyforge.org">RubyForge</a>. Although SourceForge could certainly be used for a Ruby project, RubyForge is a more popular option. One of the reasons is that any RubyGem your project releases automatically becomes installable through the <a href="http://rubygems.org/">RubyGems</a> package management system with a simple one-line incantation:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>sudo gem install &lt;yourprojectname&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Another reason to use RubyForge is discoverability. RubyForge only hosts projects related in some way to Ruby. So, your project will stand out a lot more in its category than with a much larger site like SourceForge.</p>
<p>Given RubyForge&rsquo;s advantages, and my own interest in minimizing the work needed to maintain an Open Source project, Rubidium will be hosted on RubyForge.</p>
<h1 id="requesting-a-project-space">Requesting a Project Space</h1>
<p>Having decided on RubyForge as Rubidium&rsquo;s host, all that&rsquo;s left is to ask for free services. You&rsquo;ll need to <a href="http://rubyforge.org/account/register.php">register for a user account</a> if you haven&rsquo;t done so already. Then, simply <a href="http://rubyforge.org/register/projectinfo.php">apply for project space</a>. After about three business days, you should be notified whether your project was accepted.</p>
<p>Several days ago, I completed this process for Rubidium. Its new home on RubyForge will be:</p>
<p><a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/rbtk">http://rubyforge.org/projects/rbtk</a></p>
<p>The Rubidium home page can be found at:</p>
<p><a href="http://rbtk.rubyforge.org">http://rbtk.rubyforge.org</a></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing useful there yet, a situation that will hopefully be fixed in a few weeks.</p>
<h1 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h1>
<p>With powerful free services now available for the Rubidium project, we&rsquo;ll want to start taking advantage of them. The next articles in this series will discuss some ways of doing so.</p>
