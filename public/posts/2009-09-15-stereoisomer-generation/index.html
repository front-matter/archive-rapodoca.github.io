<p>Recently, <a href="http://timvdm.blogspot.com/">Tim Vandermeersch</a> kicked off a series of articles on stereoisomer perception in Open Babel:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://timvdm.blogspot.com/2009/09/symmetry-classes-how-to-get-them-and.html">Symmetry classes: How to get them and what to do with them</a></li>
<li><a href="http://timvdm.blogspot.com/2009/09/as-promised-here-are-some-molecules.html">Untitled</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Tim cites a <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ci00016a003">key paper by Razinger et al.</a> (<a href="http://www.mcs.csueastbay.edu/~kbalasub/reprints/282.pdf">free reprint</a>) that details how a working stereoisomer generation system can be designed.</p>
<p>Two aspects of this problem make it hard: (1) the differentiation of atoms that might be stereocenters from those that will never be; and (2) the exclusion of stereoisomers that are equivalent because of higher molecular symmetry properties (think cis/trans 4-methylcyclohexanol, which has only two steroisomers, not four, neither of which are chiral).</p>
<p>A key feature of the Razinger approach is the use of molecular <em>automorphism groups</em>. An automorphism group is composed of all mappings of atoms in the same molecule that don&rsquo;t make or break any of the original bonds.</p>
<p>How to determine autmorphism groups? One approach would be through a <a href="/articles/2008/11/17/substructure-search-from-scratch-in-java-part-1-the-atom-mapping-problem">VF implementation</a>, such as the one found in <a href="http://metamolecular.com/mx">Mx</a>.</p>
<p>If you needed to generate all stereoisomers of a molecule, which tools and/or approaches would you use?</p>
