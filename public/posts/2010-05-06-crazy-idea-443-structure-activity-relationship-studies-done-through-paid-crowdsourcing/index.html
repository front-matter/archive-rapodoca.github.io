<p>What on earth does this have to do with Structure-Activity Relationship studies?</p>
<p>Imagine a Trada-like marketplace designed to bring those with skill in directing SAR studies together with those needing skill in that area.</p>
<p>I could outline in more detail how something like this could work, but I&rsquo;m much more interested in how you think it could work (or not work).</p>
<p>The place of chemists in drug discovery organizations is changing at a rapid pace. It&rsquo;s time for new business models to fill the gaps left by the crumbling old ones. (If you&rsquo;re a chemist who thinks you don&rsquo;t have a business model, then you need to reconsider this notion - fast.)</p>
<p>I have no idea whether the Trada system could work in practice for drug discovery. But one thing is clear: the failure of one business model (medicinal chemist at large company until retirement) opens opportunities for the next one to take its place. Adaptation is the only way forward.</p>
