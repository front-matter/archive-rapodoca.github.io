<p>As I&rsquo;ve said before, there&rsquo;s <a href="http://depth-first.com/articles/2007/06/29/starting-quitting-and-finishing">a big difference</a> between building cheminformatics tools and building something as complicated as a working structure editor for Web applications. Still, JChemHub is worth checking out; it won&rsquo;t solve your structure editor or display problems today, but tools like it may solve them in the future.</p>
