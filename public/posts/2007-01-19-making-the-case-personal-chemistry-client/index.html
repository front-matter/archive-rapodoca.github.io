Two very popular titles are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jmol<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->PyMol<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. A third, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bioclipse<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, is gaining in popularity. So it was with great interest that I came upon a company called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AKos Consulting &amp; Solutions<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and their Open Source application <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Personal Chemistry Client<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (PCC).</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/20070119/screenshot.png" alt="Personal Chemistry Client" title="Personal Chemistry Client"></p>
<p>PCC, as best as I can tell, is designed to be a personal chemical database. The good news is that PCC is licensed under the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->GNU General Public License<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The bad news is that PCC also requires two important things from your computer:</p>
<ul>
<li>A system capable of running the Microsoft .NET 2.0 Framework. The framework itself is included with the download. Unfortunately, this requirement rules out running PCC on Linux or Mac OSX.</li>
<li>The free (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->as in beer<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) ActiveX plugin <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ChemViewX<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hyleos<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. This plugin is also included with the download.</li>
</ul>
<p>I was able to download, install, and use PCC on my system (Windows XP Home) without a problem. Aside from some confusing behaviors of its template components, the application seems to work as described.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, PCC uses the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Chemistry Development Kit<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (CDK) for structure searching. It&rsquo;s not clear what rendering engine is used by the ChemViewX plugin. Just looking at the output, though, it may well also be CDK.</p>
<p>The emergence of PCC, an Open Source program developed by a for-profit vendor, is an exciting development. Business models may take some time to solidify, but chemistry clearly offers numerous <!-- raw HTML omitted -->peculiarities<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to take advantage of. And the folks behind PCC are well ahead of the curve.</p>
