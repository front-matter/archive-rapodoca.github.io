    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>The PubChem team has quietly introduced a new feature - 3D coordinates for many of the small molecules in its compound collection. To my knowledge, these coordinates are only currently <a href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubchem/Compound_3D/">available via FTP</a>. From the <a href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubchem/Compound_3D/README">README</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The data contained here consists of a theoretical 3D description of PubChem Compound records computed using the MMFF94s force field without coulombic terms, including MMFF charges.  Each provided theoretical 3D conformer is not a stationary point on the hyper-potential surface (i.e., is not at a minimum energy).  Rather, the theoretical 3D description is a low energy conformer selected from a conformer model (a theoretical description of the conformational flexibility of a chemical structure consisting of multiple 3D representations or poses sampled using an RMSD {root mean squared distance} threshold) describing energetically-accessible and (potentially) biologically relevant coformations of a chemical structure.</p>
<p>Not every PubChem Compound record will have a theoretical 3D description. Structures considered too large (containing more than 50 non-hydrogen atoms) or too flexible (containing more than 15 rotatable bonds) are excluded.  Furthermore, chemical structures containing elements other than H, C, N, O, F, P, S, Cl, Br, and I are also excluded.</p>
<p>Generation of theoretical 3D descriptions of small molecules is computationally intensive.  As such, some PubChem Compound records may be added at a later time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(A few open source packages for <a href="/articles/2007/12/12/simple-3d-conformer-generation-with-smi23d">generating 3D conformers</a> are also available.)</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="http://hutchison.chem.pitt.edu/">Geoff Hutchison</a> wrote in <a href="/articles/2008/05/14/the-daily-molecule-the-wonders-of-chemistry-one-molecule-at-a-time#comment-556">to suggest</a> that a potentially useful new feature of <a href="http://chempedia.com">Chempedia</a> could be the ability to directly obtain 3D coordinates for a molecule of interest.</p>
<p>One very economical way to do that would be to use PubChem&rsquo;s 3D dataset. It would also be trivial to display these coordinates as a resizable <a href="http://jmol.sourceforge.net/">Jmol applet</a>, in analogy to <a href="/articles/2008/05/19/building-chempedia-resizable-structures-with-chemwriter">Chempedia&rsquo;s recently-added 2D molecule resizing feature</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, there are many other potential uses for the PubChem conformer dataset, especially when applied to Web applications.</p>
