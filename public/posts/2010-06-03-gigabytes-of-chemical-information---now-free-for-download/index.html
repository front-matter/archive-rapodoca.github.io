<p>Who cares about patents, you say? It turns out that patents are the only large corpus of chemical information that can be freely reused without restriction. It&rsquo;s hard to overemphasize how important this quality is because most of the peer-reviewed chemical literature is locked away in a vast, balkanized, for-profit information silo that is the chemistry publication system we all know. This applies equally to supplementary experimental material and the peer-reviewed text. It&rsquo;s impossible for average researchers with average means to do anything productive with that corpus as a whole.</p>
<p>With patents, these limitations don&rsquo;t apply.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s contained in chemistry patents? Anything with a basis in chemistry that&rsquo;s ever been sold (or even considered marketable) has been through a patent process: drugs; organic LEDs; photoresists; liquid crystals; catalysts; detergents; and so on. Experimental procedures, assay results, and physical properties can all be found in chemistry patents - if you know where to look.</p>
<p>Patents are useful for other reasons as well. For example, much of the best industrial research generally never gets published in the peer-reviewed literature. It can only be found in patents.</p>
<p>Chemistry patents also have a big downside: poor use of conventions. Chemical naming, for example, can be haphazard at best and a lot of information must be inferred. A well-stocked chemical dictionary and name-to-structure software are required equipment for fishing in these waters.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just now starting to work my way through the patent material that&rsquo;s been made available from Google. It&rsquo;ll be interesting to see what new things might come from this vast collection of chemical information.</p>
