<li>Depth-First traversal</li>
<li>Implicit hydrogen detection</li>
<li>Complete system of atomic masses and isotopes based on the IUPAC Technical Report.</li>
<li>Model objects (Molecule, Atom, Bond, Superatom) based on MDL CTfile specification</li>
<li>Molfile reader and writer</li>
<li>SD File reader and writer</li>
