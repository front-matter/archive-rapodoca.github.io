In years past, scientists relied on subscription-only services such as <a href="http://www.cas.org/">Chemical Abstracts Service</a> and <a href="http://scientific.thomson.com/products/sci/">Science Citation Index</a>. But these services are starting to show their limitations, particularly with respect to being able to sell their products at an affordable price.

<p>Enter <a href="http://scilink.com">SciLink</a>, a service that could end up doing for science what <a href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a> has done for college campuses. Search for a scientist&rsquo;s name and get a (partial) list of their publications along with a list of other scientists they&rsquo;ve worked with as co-authors. No small database, SciLink already contains information on 5.8 million scientists. Although you can create your own user profile after registering, you&rsquo;re probably already in SciLink courtesy of its creative use of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=PubMed">PubMed</a> bibliographical information.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear what the future holds for SciLink. One thing is certain: free services like SciLink can be expected to proliferate over the next few years as cost squeezes and technological advances continue to take their toll on the established scientific information industry.</p>
