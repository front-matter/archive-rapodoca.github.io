When new compounds are discovered, or when the information about a compound changes, those changes can take many months or years to appear in print form due to the high cost of publication. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be that way. This article introduces a new feature to the free online chemical encyclopedia <a href="http://chempedia.com">Chempedia</a> that lets working scientists update is contents via <a href="http://wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<h1 id="about-chempedianet">About Chempedia.net</h1>
<p>A <a href="/articles/2008/04/04/chempedia-net-mashing-up-pubchem-and-wikipedia">recent article</a> introduced <a href="http://chempedia.com">Chempdia</a>, the free online chemical encyclopedia. This service is built on two of the largest <a href="/articles/2007/01/24/thirty-two-free-chemistry-databases">free and open repositories of chemical information</a> in existence: <a href="http://wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> and <a href="http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">PubChem</a>. PubChem supplies low-level chemical information such as connection tables, and Wikipedia supplies free-text descriptions of the properties and uses of certain molecules.</p>
<h1 id="which-molecules">Which Molecules?</h1>
<p>Currently, Chempedia.net only includes <a href="/articles/2008/04/02/wikipedia-for-cheminformatics-a-simple-web-api-for-finding-cas-numbers-in-compound-monographs">compound monographs</a> for about 1,000 of its over 300,000 molecules. These monographs were located by a manual process in which the titles for all Wikipedia articles were downloaded in alphabetized form; this process clustered titles that represented IUPAC nomenclature due to its use of leading numbers and symbols. IUPAC nomenclature titles were extracted, and then a script was written to extract the chemical information from these titles and combine it with that from PubChem.</p>
<p>This method, although useful for getting a service running, is clearly flawed. The biggest problem is in how to discover new compound monographs.</p>
<h1 id="why-not-put-users-in-control">Why Not Put Users in Control?</h1>
<p>Chempedia users themselves are in the best position to know when an existing Wikipedia compound monograph should appear in Chempedia but doesn&rsquo;t, when an existing monograph needs to be updated, or when a new monograph is written and needs to be linked.</p>
<p>How can the process be <a href="/articles/2006/08/19/history-of-abstracting-at-chemical-abstracts-service">automated</a>?</p>
<p>As a partial answer to this question, users <a href="http://chempedia.net/articles/new">now have the ability to notify Chempedia of any changes to a Wikipedia compound monograph</a>, and to have those changes immediately reflected in the next viewing of a Chempedia compound monograph.</p>
<h1 id="an-example">An Example</h1>
<p>As an example, let&rsquo;s take <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anandamide">anandamide</a>, a compound I&rsquo;ve had some experience with during my time as a medicinal chemist. Although the <a href="http://chempedia.net/compounds/6030">Chempedia entry for ananandamide</a> exists, there is (or as of today - was) no link to the Wikipedia compound monograph. Let&rsquo;s create one.</p>
<p>At the top of <a href="http://chempedia.com/">Chempedia&rsquo;s main menu</a>, you&rsquo;ll see a link titled &lsquo;<a href="http://chempedia.net/articles/new">Update</a>&rsquo;. Choosing this link leads to a form that will ask for two pieces of information: (1) the title of the Wikipedia article to which you want Chempedia to link - in this case &lsquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anandamide">anandamide</a>&rsquo;; and (2) <a href="/articles/2007/09/18/six-reasons-i-like-recaptcha-or-how-to-build-a-web-service-worth-talking-about">reCaptcha</a> text to keep robots from making mischief.</p>
<p>Submitting this information is all that&rsquo;s needed to create a new or updated link from Chempedia to Wikipedia. Chempedia handles the rest.</p>
<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
<p>Wikipedia is a vast source of free, high-quality, semi-structured chemical information just waiting to have good chemically-aware interfaces applied to it. Chempedia.net is an attempt to do just that, but it&rsquo;s a bit more as well. Although it may appear that Chempedia is the major beneficiary in this relationship, Wikipedia also benefits. When chemists have a tool that allows them to query and visualize Wikipedia using their native language (the chemical structure) they&rsquo;re in a better position to both use and contribute to Wikipedia itself - something I&rsquo;ve started to do.</p>
<p>This positive feedback effect is the real value of exposing Web services. The question is: who in cheminformatics is willing and able to take the risk to discover this simple principle and its benefits?</p>
