<p>FooDB is not alone: the number of <a href="http://depth-first.com/articles/2007/01/24/thirty-two-free-chemistry-databases">free chemistry databases on the Web</a> just keeps growing. How this trend ultimately plays out is anybody&rsquo;s guess.</p>
<p>One thing is clear: the point is rapidly approaching at which database aggregation technologies will start to matter. No chemist wants to search through over thirty databases to find the information they need on a molecule. They want it delivered in one quick, intuitive, user-friendly package. Here&rsquo;s another example of something that&rsquo;s <a href="http://depth-first.com/articles/tag/broken">broken</a> in cheminformatics. Like all broken things, it&rsquo;s the source of great frustration for users and great opportunity for developers.</p>
