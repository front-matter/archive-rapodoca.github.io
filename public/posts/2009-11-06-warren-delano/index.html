<p>For those who may not be familiar with his work, Warren was the creator of <a href="http://pymol.sourceforge.net/">PyMOL</a>, an open source molecular visualization package that managed to do what few other software packages (open source or otherwise) have done - build a large, dedicated community and gain widespread use in the life sciences industry. To get a glimpse at how widely used PyMOL was, take a look at <a href="http://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Covers">some of the high-profile journal covers that were created with it</a>.</p>
<p>I only met Warren in person a couple of times, but each time left me with something valuable. What struck me the most about him was his giving nature - and his enthusiasm for technology. You just couldn&rsquo;t help but like him.</p>
<p>Warren&rsquo;s family has set up a <a href="http://www.jmdelano.com/">memorial page</a>, as well as a blog to which you can post your <a href="http://warrendelano.blogspot.com/2009/11/my-brother-warren.html#comments">memories of him</a>.</p>
