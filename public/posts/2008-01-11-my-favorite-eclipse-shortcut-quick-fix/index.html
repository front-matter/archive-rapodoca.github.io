    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> is one of those great tools that is both easy to learn and extremely powerful. Eclipse&rsquo;s power comes, in part, from the number of features it offers, which seems to grow with every new release. This creates a problem though; the more features that are added to Eclipse, the more difficult it is to find them. This article focuses on one feature that every Eclipse user should know about: <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/help31/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/tasks/tasks-175.htm">Quick Fix</a>.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re creating a class from scratch and you need to add a variable. Because you&rsquo;re working in Java, you&rsquo;ll also need to specify a type. If that type is one that doesn&rsquo;t already appear in the file you&rsquo;re working on, you&rsquo;ll either need to create it or import it. It may not seem like a big deal to scroll to the top of your file, add an <code>import</code> statement, and scroll back down to continue writing, but it can really break the flow of concentration - especially considering that it may need to be done several times in just one method.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if Eclipse could handle this tedium for you?</p>
<p>Enter <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/help31/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/tasks/tasks-175.htm">Quick Fix</a>. In this example, we&rsquo;re creating a class called <code>Molecule</code> and need to add a <code>List</code> to hold its atoms. We begin by declaring the <code>atoms</code> variable:</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/20080111/list_error.png" alt="List Error" title="List Error"></p>
<p>Eclipse recognizes that <code>List</code> is a new type. Instead of manually inserting an <code>import</code> statement at the top of the file, let&rsquo;s use Quick Fix.</p>
<p>Highlighting the error and pressing [Ctrl-1] opens Quick Fix and gives us a list of options to choose from:</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/20080111/list_options.png" alt="List Options" title="List Options"></p>
<p>Quick Fix can also create a class or interface template instead of importing a class, as the screenshot above suggests.</p>
<p>We need to import the <code>java.util.List</code> interface. Double clicking on the <code>Import 'List'(java.util)</code> option inserts the import statement and allows us to continue writing:</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/20080111/list_fix.png" alt="List Fix" title="List Fix"></p>
<p>Eclipse is packed with these kinds of useful but hard to find features. Future Depth-First articles will highlight some of them.</p>
