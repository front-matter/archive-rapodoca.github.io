<p>It&rsquo;s the oxidative conversion of aromatic diamines and aromatic aldehydes into benzimidazoles. One common way of performing this reaction is in the presence of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_metabisulfite">sodium metabisulfite</a>. The question is: what&rsquo;s the role of the sodium metabisulfite and what&rsquo;s the oxidant?</p>
<p>Over at <a href="http://lab.chempedia.com">Chempedia Lab</a>, this question about <a href="http://lab.chempedia.com/questions/200/sodium-metabisulfite-in-benzimidazole-formation">the role of sodium metabisulfite in benzimidazole formation</a> stands as an excellent example of why the service was created.

<p>Unfortunately, we have no answer as of yet. What we&rsquo;re looking for is a study that clearly shows the specific role being played by sodium metabisulfite in this reaction. Know the answer? Enlighten us and <a href="http://lab.chempedia.com/faq#bounty">claim your bounty</a>!</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re tempted to post your answer or idea as a comment here, I encourage you to instead to <a href="http://lab.chempedia.com/users/login">create a Chempedia Lab account</a> and join in the discussion there.</p>
<p>You can <a href="http://depth-first.com/tags/chempedia-lab">read more about Chempedia Lab in articles posted here</a>.
