    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Directory of Open Access Journals<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (DOAJ) currently lists 2420 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Open Access<!-- raw HTML omitted --> scholarly journals. Of these, 52 currently fall under the category of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->chemistry<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Although the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->organic chemistry<!-- raw HTML omitted --> subcategory only currently lists three journals, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->general chemistry<!-- raw HTML omitted --> category actually contains several journals containing organic chemistry content, such as the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Chemical and Pharmaceutical Bulletin<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Molbank<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Clearly, the chemistry journals included in DOAJ&rsquo;s listings would not be considered to be in &ldquo;the mainstream&rdquo; by experts in the field. And that&rsquo;s exactly the point. Innovation always happens at the margins.</p>
<p>As Clayton Christensen puts it in his landmark book, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Innovator&rsquo;s Dilemma<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As we shall see, the list of leading companies that failed when confronted with disruptive changes in technology and market structure is a long one. &hellip; One theme common to all of these failures, however, is that the decisions that led to failure were made when the leaders in question were widely regarded as among the best companies in the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Replacing the word &ldquo;company&rdquo; with &ldquo;scientific journal&rdquo; leads to an important hypothesis about the future of scientific publishing.</p>
<p>And on the subject of disruptive innovation itself, Christensen writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Occasionally, however, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->disruptive technologies<!-- raw HTML omitted --> emerge: innovations that result in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->worse<!-- raw HTML omitted --> product performance, at least in the near-term. Ironically, in each of the instances studied in this book, it was disruptive technologies that precipitated the leading firms&rsquo; failure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems very unlikely that scientific publishing operates according to a different set of rules than any other technology-driven business. The coming wave of disruptive innovation will be dramatic, and the outcome completely predictable.</p>
