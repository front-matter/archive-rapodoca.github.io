Although these limitations are clearly present theoretically, what&rsquo;s the practical effect likely to be?</p>
<p>For the last two years, a series of articles highlighting specific examples from the current chemical literature have appeared here. Variously titled &ldquo;How would your cheminformatics tool do this?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Can your cheminformatics tool to this?&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Cheminformatics Puzzler&rdquo;, each entry featured an article from a mainstream chemistry journal in which SMILES, Molfile, CML, and/or InChI would be incapable of faithfully representing a centerpiece structure. The examples are taken from well-read journals in synthetic organic, natural products, and medicinal chemistry.</p>
<p>The purpose was not to bash these languages, but rather point to an important common set of limitations among them - a kind of groupthink if you will. As mentioned before, this may not be a problem at all for the work you&rsquo;re currently doing. But given the rapid exploration by chemists of areas in which cheminformatics&rsquo; standard simplifying assumptions don&rsquo;t apply, it&rsquo;s possible you&rsquo;ll need a solution sooner than you might think.</p>
<p>The remainder of this article groups these examples by topic.</p>
<h1 id="axial-chirality">Axial Chirality</h1>
<p>The literature is replete with examples of axial chirality. None of the molecular languages in common use today can represent this form of chirality. The examples below are but a small selection.</p>

<p>This example does double-duty as an example of planar chirality.</p>
