One of the hardest things about it is what you&rsquo;re forced to give up: abandoning your hard-won mental map and adopting that of the user; stripping half the product&rsquo;s features - and then stripping half of what&rsquo;s left; and fending off <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/06/featuritis_vs_t.html">featuritis</a> with a big club as the product matures. Everyone knows these things are important, but for some reason we repeat the same mistakes over and over.</p>
<p>So it was with great enthusiasm that I found Robert Hoekman, Jr.&rsquo;s new book <a href="http://www.rhjr.net/dto"><em>Designing the Obvious</em></a>. Good technical books collect illustrative examples and present them clearly. But great technical books provide a system for understanding the examples. <em>Designing the Obvious</em> is one of them.</p>
<p>As an example, have you ever considered a confirmation dialog to be a symptom of a fundamentally flawed application design? The next time you find yourself needing one of these doodads, consider this passage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only implementation-model piece of design I&rsquo;ve seen while using Backpack is the JavaScript alert message that pops open when I attempt to delete something from a Backpack page. It asks, simply, &ldquo;Are You Sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the message is a pretty standard confirmation message - which we&rsquo;re all used to seeing - it&rsquo;s a sign of the underlying system. It&rsquo;s a big ol&rsquo; banner that says &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have an undo feature and the only way I can deal with you deleting an object from your page is to interrupt your workflow with this message to make sure you know what you&rsquo;re doing.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hoekman&rsquo;s solution is simple - give your users an undo feature and ditch the confirmation dialog. This makes perfect sense, but how many times has the opposite been done instead?</p>
<p>Sometimes the obvious is far from obvious.</p>
