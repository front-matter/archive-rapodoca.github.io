<p>The &ldquo;destandardization&rdquo; of the GUI has been underway for several years. From Web applications like <a href="http://www.picnik.com/">Picnik</a> to <a href="http://youtube.com">Flash video players</a> to Apple&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/">iTunes application</a>, users are getting increasingly used to the idea that not every program needs to look like Microsoft Office, and that some of them never should have in the first place.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/20080129/aerith.png" alt="Aerith" title="Aerith"></p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s possible to infuse Java Swing applications with the look and feel of this new breed of GUI. The new book <a href="http://www.filthyrichclients.com/"><em>Filthy Rich Clients</em></a> shows how. Covering topics ranging from threading to animation to compositing, this well-written book is a goldmine for anyone wanting to break out of a GUI rut.</p>
<p>The use of reflections, animation, fading and the like in serious applications may seem frivolous. But used in the proper context, these effects can add a great deal to usability and appeal.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s frivolous use of memory and CPU cycles has a strange way of becoming next year&rsquo;s must-have feature.</p>
