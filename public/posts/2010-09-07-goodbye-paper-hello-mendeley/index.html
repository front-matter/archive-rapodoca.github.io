<p><a href="http://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a> lets you create an annotated library from a raw collection of your many papers. Make a single directory, throw in all of your PDFs, and Mendely does the rest. Or at least that&rsquo;s how I used it. From <a href="http://www.mendeley.com/bibliography-maker-database-generator/">the documentation</a>:</p>

<p>How did I go from binders full of paper to PDFs? Google of course. I searched for the title of each paper and, if necessary, the author with the most distinctive last name. In most cases my first three hits had a direct link to the publisher site, from which I downloaded the PDF.</p>
<p>Although I was impressed with Mendeley&rsquo;s ease of use, I did hit a couple of gotchas:</p>
<ul>
<li>In my first attempt, I downloaded a batch of PDFs into my system&rsquo;s &lsquo;Downloads&rsquo; directory. Then I deleted them, thinking that Mendeley was making its own copies. It was not. I had to re-download a few PDFs because of that mistake.</li>
<li>Apparently, if you download multiple copies of the same PDF, Mendeley will create multiple citations. And simply deleting the underlying PDF won&rsquo;t fix the problem. You&rsquo;ll need to delete the reference to the file as well, it seems. Actually I&rsquo;m still not sure I have that part figured out yet.</li>
<li>Although Mendeley is good at extracting bibliographical citation information, it&rsquo;s not perfect. For example, with some older ACS references that begin somewhere in the middle of a page, nothing meaningful could be extracted for title, author, etc. In those cases, the only solution is manual entry.</li>
</ul>
<p>After a couple of hours, I had a library of 156 citations, complete with full title and bibliographical citation.</p>
<p>I must say that having access to my library this way is very liberating. I no longer need to worry about whether I filed that paper on fingerprint optimization for substructure search under &lsquo;fingerprint&rsquo; or &lsquo;sss&rsquo;. I just search for keywords, authors, or browse the full library.</p>
<p>Another pleasant surprise: Mendeley makes it easy to find all papers by a given author. I was surprised to find author connections among some of the works I thought I knew pretty well. Now if there were just a way to hook this author information into LinkedIn&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also eyeing the <a href="http://www.mendeley.com/blog/design-research-tools/our-first-iphone-app-has-arrived/">iPhone app</a> for use with my iPad as a more comfortable way to read my papers without having to print them out at all.</p>
<p>I <a href="/articles/2007/03/22/why-i-still-dont-use-connotea">haven&rsquo;t been a user of reference managers in the past</a>, but Mendeley has gotten enough right for me to make the switch.</p>
