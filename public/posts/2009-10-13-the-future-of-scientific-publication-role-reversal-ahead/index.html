<p>What Alex is talking about is the ongoing revolution in information distribution that&rsquo;s slowly making its presence known in scientific publication. And he&rsquo;s right on target in identifying this transformation&rsquo;s rate-limiting step: the academic rewards system.</p>
<p>This raises an interesting question: given the inevitable changes ahead for scientific publication, both as a component of science and as a business, how will the academic rewards system adapt?</p>
<p>Here are some past articles that might be useful when thinking about what the future holds and more interestingly, ideas for accelerating its arrival:</p>
