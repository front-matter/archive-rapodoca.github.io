The one day event was a great chance to meet people with all levels of experience in starting companies. The speakers were amazing.
The speaker lineup looks at least as good as the one last year and includes Marc Andreessen (Netscape), Michael Arrington (TechCrunch), Jeff Bezos (Amazon), and David Heinemeier Hansson (37signals/Rails). Even so, some of the best speakers from last year were the ones not so well known.">
