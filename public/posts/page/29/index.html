        Chemical Inventory Systems: Cheminformatics&#39; Problem Child?

      <p>Chemical inventory is one of those things that few in cheminformatics think about but many in chemistry do. Having worked in research labs in both industry and academia, it seems that chemical inventory, and particularly the software/hardware to manage it, is one of those universal problems in chemistry.</p>
<h1 id="what-problem">What Problem?</h1>
<p>What problem, you may ask? The problem of finding a sample of a given substance present somewhere in a research lab. Perhaps you need a TLC or NMR standard. Maybe you&rsquo;re interested in starting a synthesis and don&rsquo;t want to waste money buying what you already have. You might even have just run out of your personal supply of a reagent and need to get more quick.</p>

<p>This information has always been available - but at a price.

      <p>One of the bits of feedback I&rsquo;ve received during the development of <a href="http://chemvoice.com">Chemvoice</a> is to break the site&rsquo;s content down into categories. Fair enough, but what exactly should these categories be and how many of them? Chemistry is the central science, and nowhere is that more apparent than in its <a href="/articles/2007/08/27/the-long-tail-and-chemistry-why-so-many-acs-meeting-talks-are-uninteresting">long tail</a>.</p>
<p>For the unfamiliar, <a href="http://chemvoice.com">Chemvoice</a> is a <a href="/articles/2010/05/12/chemvoice-making-it-a-little-easier-to-be-a-great-chemist">social chemistry news service</a>. The idea is simple: let readers themselves decide what&rsquo;s newsworthy and give them simple tools to make their opinions visible to others.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten just a few too many of these kinds of these DOI fail messages lately and it&rsquo;s starting to get old. Call me crazy, but when <a href="http://depth-first.com/articles/2010/04/15/wiley-doi-fail">a DOI resolution still doesn&rsquo;t work after one month</a> and there&rsquo;s not so much as a confirmation that the problem is being looked at (or that maybe I&rsquo;m doing something wrong), that&rsquo;s no way to serve customers or build confidence.</p>
<p>As part of <a href="http://depth-first.com/articles/2010/04/08/wanted-a-few-good-chemists">an ongoing project</a>, I&rsquo;ve found numerous examples of failed DOI resolutions. The problem is that the source of these failures is the links contained in the syndication feeds created by the publishers themselves.</p>

      <p>Longtime readers of this blog know that I think <a href="http://depth-first.com/articles/2008/07/15/javascript-for-cheminformatics">JavaScript for Cheminformatics</a> is an idea with a lot of potential. Recently, I ran across <a href="http://github.com/chemhack/jchemhub">JChemHub</a>, an open source toolkit for developing client-side cheminformatics applications.</p>
<p>JChemHub is written from scratch in JavaScript using the <a href="http://code.google.com/closure/">Google Closure</a> library. Although documentation on the project is sparse, I was able to get started by following the instructions in the README file.</p>
<p>One tip: the sample HTML files are contained within the <code>jchemhub/views</code> directory. For example, to run the reaction display demo, open the file <code>jchemhub/view/demo.html</code>.</p>

<p>But to use the Web to its fullest potential requires both a service and users of that service that &ldquo;get it&rdquo;. For too long, the services have been lacking.

<p>The idea of gas engines was by no means new, but this was the first time that a really serious effort had been made to put them on the market. They were received with interest rather than enthusiasm and I do not recall any one who thought that the internal combustion engine could ever have more than a limited use. All the wise people demonstrated conclusively that the engine could not compete with steam. They never thought that it might carve out a career for itself. That is the way with wise people - they are so wise and practical that they always know to a dot just why something cannot be done; they always know the limitations.</p>
