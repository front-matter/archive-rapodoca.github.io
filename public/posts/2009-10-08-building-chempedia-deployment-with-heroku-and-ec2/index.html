If you&rsquo;ve ever had to install, configure and maintain a production server from scratch, you may know the job as being both tedious and thankless.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why <a href="http://metamolecular.com">Metamolecular</a> is doing something different for the re-launch <a href="http://chempedia.com">Chempedia</a>. Rather than provisioning a server from scratch, as we&rsquo;ve done with previous applications, we&rsquo;re giving <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a> a shot.</p>
<p>Heroku is a Web application deployment platform based on Amazon&rsquo;s <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Elastic Compute Cloud</a> (EC2). Among many advantages offered by Heroku are: dead-simple application deplyment through git; on-demand scaling; and zero-maintenance. With Heroku, the idea of a &ldquo;server&rdquo; ceases to exist - instead, all you need to consider is your application and how much power you want behind it at any given time. A <a href="/articles/2009/10/02/tech-fridays-deploying-rails-and-rack-applications-with-heroku">recent presentation</a> by <a href="http://twitter.com/bmizerany">Blake Mizerany</a> convinced me that Heroku is worth considering for Chempedia.</p>
<p>Over the next several weeks, I&rsquo;ll be discussing the creation and deployment of Chempedia, the technologies we&rsquo;ve used, and the obstacles we&rsquo;ve overcome in building a data-driven, socially-oriented Web application for chemistry.</p>
