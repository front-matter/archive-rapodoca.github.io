<p>Creating and open sourcing your own custom components is one way to go. Building on top of existing open source tools like <a href="http://cdk.sf.net">CDK</a>, <a href="http://openbabel.sf.net">Open Babel</a>, <a href="/articles/tag/octet">Octet</a> and <a href="http://joelib.sf.net">JOELib</a> is another.</p>
<p>Haider&rsquo;s work raises an interesting question. Has anyone assembled a complete, ready to install general purpose chemical database package built from open source components? It for no other reason, such an exercise would give an excellent idea of what <a href="/articles/2007/01/03/open-source-and-open-data-why-we-should-eat-our-own-dogfood">the dogfood tastes like</a>.</p>
