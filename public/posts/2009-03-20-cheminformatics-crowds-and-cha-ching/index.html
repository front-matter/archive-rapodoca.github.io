<p>This second paper on the subject of power laws and synthetic organic chemistry (<a href="http://depth-first.com/articles/2009/03/16/cheminformatics-in-the-popular-press-the-long-tail-of-structural-scaffolds">previous paper</a>) is chock full of interesting and potentially useful observations on the principles behind the art, science, and business of synthetic organic chemistry.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/20090320/scale-free.png" alt="Scale-Free" title="Scale-Free"></p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re a chemical supplier looking to optimize return on investment or an assistant professor struggling to do &lsquo;relevant&rsquo; research, this article is a must-read.</p>
<p>Take this, for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose a speciality-chemicals company produces P products. A relevant question one might ask is then what set of substrates, S, and reaction pathways should the company use to minimize its overall production cost? &hellip; The link between this general formulation and the architecture of the network is the correlation between the cost of a substrate and its local network connectivity. Analysis of specific substances reveals that synthetically popular substances are less expensive than poorly connected ones, with the cost per mole being proportional to the inverse square root of the molecule&rsquo;s network connectivity &hellip; . Using this cost relation, stochastic search algorithms (based on simulated annealing Monte Carlo optimization) can be back-propagated from the products to find optimal substrates, which minimize the total production costs, C<!-- raw HTML omitted -->tot<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. &hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This kind of analysis is groundbreaking because it uses cheminformatics to link mathematical models used for years in other fields with the business and science of organic chemistry. It&rsquo;s a perspective rarely taken and long overdue.</p>
