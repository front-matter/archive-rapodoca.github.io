<p>IBM recently announced the donation to <a href="http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">PubChem</a> of more than 2.4 million chemical structures extracted from the patent literature and biomedical journals. (<a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ibm-contributes-data-to-the-national-institutes-of-health-to-speed-drug-discovery-and-cancer-research-innovation-135275888.html">link</a>, <a href="http://cen.acs.org/articles/89/web/2011/12/PubChem-Data.html?cq_ck=1323965915973">link</a>)  According to <a href="https://listserv.indiana.edu/cgi-bin/wa-iub.exe?A2=ind1112&amp;L=CHMINF-L&amp;D=0&amp;T=0&amp;P=34282">Marc Nicklaus</a> of NIH:</p>

<p>&hellip; Non-U.S. patents are included as the source of structures in this data donation. This information is not directly part of the donated file itself, though. There is a link for each record that points back to an IBM web page that provides some additional information (apparently for free) of the type, &ldquo;PMIDs and patent numbers found for documents containing IBM Structure
ID=0015AFBF08D8F183C1F8E32A430CFFEB.&rdquo;  What one finds there in this case is
simply: EP0244956A1 &hellip;presumably the European patent in which this compound appeared.</p>
<p>BTW, these data were donated to both PubChem and us (NCI CADD Group). We&rsquo;re currently processing the file and will incorporate the structures into our services on <a href="http://cactus.nci.nih.gov">http://cactus.nci.nih.gov</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The donation resulted from research performed using <a href="http://www-935.ibm.com/services/us/gbs/bao/siip/">IBM&rsquo;s Strategic IP Insight Platform (SIIP)</a>. Last year, Stephen Boyer discussed technical aspects of the patent mining work as it applies to cheminformatics (below).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>IBM&rsquo;s donation should be viewed in the context of related recent events including the <a href="http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v28/n7/full/nbt0710-631.html">release of screening data</a> for over 300,000 structures against malaria by GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis.</p>
<p>Are data releases like these by large companies merely a fad or the start of something big? Only time will tell. But given the ongoing pain and renewed drive to innovate in the pharmaceutical industry, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to see multiple announcements along the same lines in the coming year.</p>
