A growing assortment of Open Source journal management systems is available today. Recently, I was introduced to one of these packages by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Egon Willighagen<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as part of my involvement with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->CDK News<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<h1 id="open-journal-systems">Open Journal Systems</h1>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Open Journal Systems<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (OJS) automates the process of manuscript submission, peer review, editorial review, article release, and article indexing. All of these elements are, of course, cited as major costs by established publishers intent on maintaining their current business models.</p>
<p>OJS appears to work in much the same way as automated systems being run by major publishers. In fact, OJS is already in use by more than <!-- raw HTML omitted -->800 journals<!-- raw HTML omitted --> written in ten languages worldwide.</p>
<p>Did I mention that OJS is free software - as in speech? The developers of OJS have licensed their work under the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->GPL<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, giving publishers the ability to control every aspect of how their journal management system operates. Standing out from the crowd will no doubt be an essential component of staying competitive in a world in which almost anyone can start their own journal.</p>
<h1 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h1>
<p>And there&rsquo;s even better news: OJS has competition. Publishers can select from no fewer than seven open source journal management systems: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->DPubs<!-- raw HTML omitted -->; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OpenACS<!-- raw HTML omitted -->; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->GAP<!-- raw HTML omitted -->; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->HyperJournal<!-- raw HTML omitted -->; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SciX<!-- raw HTML omitted -->; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Living Reviews ePubTk<!-- raw HTML omitted -->; and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TOPAZ<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<h1 id="the-last-word">The Last Word</h1>
<p>Open Source tools like Open Journal Systems have the potential to radically change the rules of the scientific publication game. By slashing the costs of both success and failure in scientific publication to almost zero, these systems are set to unleash an unprecedented wave of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->disruptive innovation<!-- raw HTML omitted --> - and not a moment too soon. What are the true costs of producing a quality Open Access scientific publication - and who pays? Will the idea of starting your own Open Access journal to address deficiencies with existing offerings catch on, especially in chemistry, chemical informatics, and computational chemistry? Before long, we will have answers to these questions.</p>
