# archive-rapodoca.github.io
 
A fork of the rapodaca.github.io repository content, which hosts the [Depth-First](https://depth-first.com) blog. Using Hugo instead of Metalsmith.js as static site generator, and RSS instead of Atom for the feed. The RSS feed includes the full content of the posts, not just the summaries, and all 900+ posts and not just the most recent 25.

The blog is archived in the [Rogue Scholar](https://rogue-scholar.org) science blog archive.
